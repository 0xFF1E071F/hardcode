    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
============================
To make this demo several tools were used:
Audio track is done using sonant-js live
(Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Jake Taylor, Copyright (c) 2011 Marcus Geelnard )
The sonant-js sound generation routine (modified by me) is also used.

Packing the code is done using:
Google closure compiler, http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
GLSL minifier: http://glslunit.appspot.com/compiler.html
JsExe, http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=59298

I want to thank the original authors for providing these tools!

Thanks to Iq for great articles of ray marching and procedural content generation.

Also thanks for Mercury for publishing their improvements for sphere tracing performance! :)

And last but not least thanks for all awsome people sharing their knowledge about ray marching in
Pouet raymarching toolbox and other related threads.
