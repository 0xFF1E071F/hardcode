SHORT DESCRIPTION

Guide the packets through the grid by laying data paths. One packet at a time
is easy, but wait till they come in numbers! For once, you will be glad that
it's not 3D!




SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* IBM-PC compatible or Acorn PC board

* EGA or VGA (On a CGA, you'll get darker colours)

* black&white or colour monitor

* DOS (Version 3 or maybe less)
  Windows 3.1/95/98/NT (you can run it in a window)

* PC speaker & Adlib sound are supported.
  Acorn users without PC speaker can use the BIOS option.



YOUR INSTRUCTIONS:

Guide the bit packets (flashing red) towards the data sinks (white) by laying
data paths (black) within the grid. A packet may be delivered to any data sink.

Newly-arrived packets are ready to be released into the grid after they have
flashed once. At daytime, you have 20 seconds to release a packet before it
times out. Four seconds before timeout, a warning signal will sound. At
nighttime, packets must be released immediately.

Switch paths on/off by placing the cursor at the desired location and pressing
Switch. The four paths around the cursor will toggle.

SCORING:

Deliver packet ....................... 10 pts
Release packet immediately ........... 15 pts
Release two packets at once .......... 75 pts
Bonus for level done or skipped ..... 200 pts
Every 1000 points .............. 1 extra life
