 * Vote for the charts *

  Due to the small size of the Wilby diskmag, we are going to make only two
 charts, trying to solve two easy questions: who is the most popular scener?
 which is the most popular demogroup?

  You can vote any person (no matter he is a coder, musician, graphist,
 diskmag editor...) or demogroup as long as you don't vote yourself or your
 group. The first one will get 5 points, the second 4 and so on.

 * Articles *

  Place in the space below your articles, but, hey, that's a little mag,
 so there is no place for those biiiiiig "do whatever you want in 3D by
 simply reading this two megs text" articles... ;-)
  Write anything you want, but please do not to use more than one 51x16
 page plus a title and name of the writer (as dotted below): I know it
 isn't very much, but it will allow you to express your opinion while not
 expending too much time in the writing.
  One last thing: english please, so everyone in the worldwide scene can
 understand you...
