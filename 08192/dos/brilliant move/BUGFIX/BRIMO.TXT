This 8k intro is a production of Future Hackers.
You are allowed to copy this intro free if it and following files (i.e.
BRIMO.TXT) are not modifyed.  You may include this file into commercial
packages, but you MUST copy it to any one who requests.
It is being distributed 'AS IS'.  Authors are not liable for any damage,
direct or indirect caused by this program.

Designed specially for Enlight'96 demo party.
Ranked 3rd at 8k intro compo.


Hardware requirements:

þ An VGA video card.  There's no gonzo programming, so almost any VGA card
  suits.

þ i80386 or compatible CPU.

þ 512 (decimal) kilobytes of conventional RAM.

If there's any problems during execution, try to run 'BRIMO -'.


We planned to create more, but there were some problems.  For example,
Dr Bug's VGA monotor became out of order a month before Enlight.  So the
most part of code was written at HGC with 9inc BW monitor...  That was
time of bad luck for Dr Bug:  his both HDD were spoiled too, so almost all
programs that were written during this summer were lost...  (DB: no one here
who wants to gift me a HDD? :-) ).
But that's not all.  Our graphic artist were ill before the party...  :-(
Hm...  Ok, so this intro was written in 3 days.

You have a question about bugfix version?  Yeah, we hope it is really bugfix.
There were some problems at the party:  part of intro containing fire didn't
work at compo machine...  So it was removed.  But, it reality, this version is
not just a bugfix:  some code is added.  But it was in mind BEFORE Enlight,
but implemendet just today, when Dr Bug got his VGA monitor back...

Compo version is called 'RENYXA'.  Just because if you read these latinic
letters as cyrillic, it means 'nonsense'.
