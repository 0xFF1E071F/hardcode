			       Fractal Genesis
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just another nice voxel-based mini-demo. If you (don't) like it, have any
comments or just want to talk about gfx, fractals or coding, contact me:
gloth@math.uni-muenster.de.

Fractal genesis was inspired by the mars mini-demo and the book "The science
of fractal images". It runs on a 386, although a 486 is recommended.
