	Ritual are an italian demogroup formed approximatively in the end
 of the 1995 by Ramas and Super Keyby. At this date Ramas alias was "Zac"
 and with Super Keyby he was a member of UT0PiA. After a few weeks  Chaos
 Ship joined Ritual. Up to April '96 Ritual  were in a good  peace, 'till
 Spike joined. Then Ritual thought they were ready  to release  something
 intresting (the only releases the had done were some bbs-intro and  some
 S3M/MOD files). So they  started up working in  Chaos Ship  house  every
 Week-End, from 1am to 5am :>. In one of this meeting, FASTRO  has  born.
	It were Ritual's first official intro and it was realized in just
 a few (about 2) hours of ASM-Coding. FASTRO  had  been  released at  the
 beginning of May '96. Ramas/Chaos Ship/Spike worked on it. 
	After this, Super Keyby decided to release some S3M, MOD and  new
 IT wich he had on his HD on the "SBPRO\ST\S" dir,  and that is  what  he
 have done. 
	Super Keyby has just released some ITs: One  World (his first  IT
 ever)  and  Text,  wich  is  quite  experimental.  Infact  none  of  the
 instruments is a real sample, some  samples are  text files  and one  of
 them is also JPG (of Meg Ryan! <grin>)
	Chaos Ship  released, 04-Jun-1996,  RageTro, a VGA Intro for Rage 
 BBS. Nothing spectacular, but a very good work for a person who claim to
 be a Swapper :-).... so, we changed his status in Coder :-)
	On  14-Jun-1996  Super  Keyby felt  very alone,  so he decided to
 release something, and there is.... Burp.S3M... Puah :-)...
	Super Keyby *STILL* felt  very alone,  so he  decided to  release
 something else :-).. : D-Stroy, an IT.
	It's PartyTime! RTL-TSOA.RAR from Super Keyby and RTL-INFE.RAR by
 KrisPanda, a new member! :-)
	Yep, you know, parties gives a  good inspiration, so  Super Keyby
 composed 2 new songs during the  Summer Encounter '96 (which  were nicer
 than compo's one :-), but who cares. KrisPanda arrived 20th, Super Keyby
 21st... :-)
	The 2 new songs are called: RTL-ANGL.RAR ("A Beautiful Angel")  &
 RTL-XXXX.RAR ("XXXX").
	Yeah!  Good  time  in  Ritual!  4 New  Members  joined! They are:
 BitScout, Pixy, BugMan. Some member,  instead,  decided  to  drop  their
 friendship with Ritual (Spike, KrisPanda).
	Meanwhile, a new release come from Super Keyby. But Ritualers are
 working hard on their first big release, the TripTro! Stay Tuned!
	The  new  release  is  called  "In  to  the  feelings.  Part 1" - 
 RTL-ITF1.IT and it's a 8 minutes long strange music... :-)
	BitScout  gave  us  his  first  release!  It's  a  GiF file, wich 
 contains his logo. It's called BitScout.Gif and it's only 3k long!
	We  was  so  happy  about  BitScout.Gif  that  we  asked   him  a
 full-featured Ritual logo. Here it is: Ritual.Gif!
	Ueee! :) We finally have got photos of us!
	Release Time for Super Keyby (Hey... have you seen that SK always
 release two file per time? Maybe that he's always  got 2 inspiration  at
 the same time? :).. Well,  nobody knows),  which released  2 new  songs.
 They are "Sydney is too far for me"  (an S3M)  and  "Crying For You" (an
 IT). Crying for You is a Remake of an old MOD by Super Keyby: his  first
 MOD ever, wich can be placed around '91!!
	Ramas & Super Keyby release  the Hobbit Intro - Text Mode/Adlib -
 386friend! :-)
