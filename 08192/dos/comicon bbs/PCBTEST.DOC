Notes:

        (1)     Oops! Thought that i had read PCBOARD.SYS correctly.
                But.. guess i found that 2 word handles didnt work.. (eek!).
                So i scanned the PCBOARD.SYS through some times and found that
                i've read something which looks like the users "firstname".
                But to my luck this was easy to correct (peew!).

        (2)     I have not had the time to add this feature in yet..
                Even though i have it in the .INI file .. sorry!


This short documentation will breifly tell you how to install, and use PCBTest,
under PCBoard v15.2x+ (?).


To install simply modify the INI file as suits your needs.
Secondly edit your pcbtest.bat so that it contains the following line :

d:\path\pcbtest.exe %3 %1 d:\path\pcbtest.ini


"d", and "path" are the current drive, and path where PCBTest is located.
During runtime %3 will be replaced by the output text file (file DIR), and
%1 would be replaced with the actual filename.


To use it, ahem, what could be said here... it works fine on multi-node for me,
(have not tried to upload on two or more nodes at one time...).
