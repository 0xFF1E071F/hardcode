Tiny.exe is a little Direct3d 8.0 program.
This is not a win32 assembly demo, this is Visual C++ code !
You need DirectX 8.0 installed to run that short proggy.

Small graphics hints: There is no bugs in normal computing !
I just like "flat" shading (gouraud is too smooth). there
is two lights with an addtional specular white spot. The
complete EXE is 5 Kb long.

Have fun and keep on coding unusefull things like this !
