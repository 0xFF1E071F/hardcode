                              .About the intro.
                              -----------------

This intro needs a fairly powerful graphics card (AMD 7850 works OK). It won't run
correctly on most laptop videocards. If your videocard isn't fast enough, the middle
part will run really horribly slow, and if you don't have 2 GB VRAM and at least
80 GB/sec bandwidth, the last part will black out completely. Sorry, it's just the
nature of the effect we're doing. As much as I hate to say it, you can always watch
the intro on YouTube... (https://youtu.be/LcdlDnw8VFs)

< Warning: spoilers >

This intro started from an idea I've had for some time, watching oldskool entries
at various parties: why should only old platforms have all the pre-rendered
cheating fun? Of course, the Revision compo machine is already extremely powerful,
so to make it worth to pre-render an effect it should be extremely computational
heavy. I decided to try fluid dynamics in a 256*256*256 box.

Of course, repeating an animation would make it far too clear that it is an
animation, so I had to precalc for a long time, and I needed to find something
to entertain the audience inbetween. Enter the idea of the loading-bar joke-intro,
the name of the intro, and the idea of loading a spaceship that takes off using the
fluid dynamics smoke.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to quite finish the entry at the partyplace. Nvidias
latest driver gave internal compile errors on the minified shader (hence the separate
exe in this final), my laptop turned out to be even slower than expected, I lost time
due to a cable I forgot at home (thanks to DJefke for helping out) so I had to submit
an unfinished version. The unfinished 3rd part fell flat on its face and I doubt many
of the audience recognized the smoke as genuine fluid dynamics due to the crappy
coloring :( At least the reaction to the joke-part was exactly as I had hoped it would be.

So, this final is a lot closer to what I wanted it to be. The colors and materials
still suck, but I'm not going to convert the code to assembler (the last big possible
improvement) to make room for that. Further efforts will go towards improving tools
so I don't lose as much time at the partyplace. Greetings to everyone I talked to at
Revision, you made my party feel more like a party and less like a marathon coding session.
