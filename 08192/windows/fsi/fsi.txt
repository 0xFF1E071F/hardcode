requires win9x/directx/512x384x32
and lots of megahertz for best performance
(600 of them is nice, 333 of them is chunky but watchable).

entirely coded in C.
hence its evil speed and size.
not that I could turn on size optimizations.
satanic vc5 managed to convert the blue warpy
thing into a blank screen if I turned off speed
optimisations.
there's still a silly rounding bug in there somewhere.
thanks to (null) for the particle drawer.

what does FSI mean, anyway ?

Fucking Shoddy Intro ?

Don't know, sounded good at the time.
