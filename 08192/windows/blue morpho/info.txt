from  celestial dust
over	intangible stretches
under un-knowable depths
with  esoteric motion
one   glint
of    life


some technical points of interest:

 * uses mipmapped 3D textures and selects a mipmap based on a distance along raymarching rays to create a fake depth-of-field effect.
 * uses a gray-scott reaction-diffusion simulation to create a volumetric tree-like form.
 * doesn't use framebuffer objects.
