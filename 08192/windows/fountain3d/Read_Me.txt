=> Fountain3d by: Patton / Zaïebanï (01-Mar-2003)
   the long awaited sequel of the same called 256b intro

=> sys.req.
   *ZX Spectrum +48k running approx. at 1GHz
    (for heavy realtime fpu particle & ripple calculations)
   *final cartridge III with 128mb extended memory
    (for fast & smooth initializing and pre-calculating)
   *ultra-fat agnus with 32mb on board
    (cause this intro is opengl accelerated)
   *and some headphones would be nice
    (cause this intro has a mamojebïc(tm) tune)

=> very very important note:
   this intro was made just for fun in two days,
   so don't expect to see anything special in 65536 bits
