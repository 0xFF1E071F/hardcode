<h2>niL sourcecode realease 1</h2>

<p>This src is all you need to recompile the intro niL by
Factory. </p>

<p>As one can see by the name, it was going to be something
different, then I got the idea of using it for an 8k, so this how
it turned out. The cade is pretty much 80% from a week before
coven when I got a fairly decent comp (a p200mmx, as opposed to
the 486-133 that I was using) with out acceleration, ergo many of
the effects are made so they run halfway decently on a
non-accelerated machine. I used vc6 for the final work, but the
project was started with vc5, so it should work with both.</p>

<p>A couple of things to note about this code:</p>

<ul>
    <li>This code was based on (ie. I ripped the core bits out
        of) some example code on the net, I have no clue as to
        where it was from..</li>
    <li>Quite alot of code has been commented out, vc seems to be
        quite dumb in removing uncalled functions.</li>
    <li>the header.exe is a little program I wrote myself..
        should be pretty explanatory.</li>
    <li>the exe produced was packed with upx v0.92 with --best</li>
    <li>one might note that the section class is far from used to
        it's fullest potential, it was originally going to be
        used as the only way of rendering in the intro, but that
        changed..</li>
    <li>some parts are really unoptimized, the b&amp;w particle
        effect and the knot effects are particularly bad..</li>
    <li>the intro really should be going fullscreen properly..</li>
    <li>some of the effects look crap on a decently bright
        monitor, my monitor isn't so thus I didn't notice.</li>
    <li>color sucks..</li>
    <li>as do comments..</li>
</ul>
