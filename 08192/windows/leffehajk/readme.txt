Intro entry at Leifhack 2017 at Veddö

The aim was to make a simple raymarched 4k entry with a nice square wave solo and some pads and a base. I barely missed the 4k limit (with 100 bytes) and the music was not completed because of a bug and size constraint. The party was great though!

Visuals
Animated 3d noise smoothstepped into a tunnel (shadertoy and iq algos)

Audio
Synth was written from scratch at party place but had a nasty bug that made it impossible to create pads and solo

Tools
gnurocket client + experimental tracker
bin2h
crinkler
shadertoy + iq resources
visual studio
flash develop
sublime + glsl syntax highlighting
shader minifier
