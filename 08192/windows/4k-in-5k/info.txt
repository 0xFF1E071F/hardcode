MM02 4K-IN-5K by Min & Merry.

The first 4K intro that fits in only 5k! :)
We reached the deadline with our intro oversized :( So we claim for a 5k category lol.

Code, visuals and so on by, oh surprise, Min & Merry! Music by Merry.
Special thanks to Shash^Collapse for allowing us to debug on his PC empowered with more powerful astronauts!
And to Technik for allowing us to re-export 4klang music  on his PC.

Greets and respect to Collapse & Gatitos!
