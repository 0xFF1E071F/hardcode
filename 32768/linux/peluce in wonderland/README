  PWP: PELUCE IN WONDERLAND
  
  1st at Elevator 2000 introcompo

  As the compo didn't have any surprisingly good entries, we had to win.
  Simple as shit.

  Peluce is our usual style except that it's resolution-independent and
  doesn't have any ansi graphics.

  Everything you see should be taken dead seriously, as usual.

  The texts are still in Finnish only.

The binaries

  bin/peluce-unpacked	linux/i386, uncompressed, using glibc 2.0
  bin/peluce-packed     linux/i386, compressed using gzexe (urgh)
  bin/peluce-static	static binary for linux/i386

  Other platforms: compile it yourself.
  Try editing makefile and typing make.

Running

  It uses pure text output.

  While coding this, PWPlib suddenly got some irritating bugs we
  couldn't fix in time. So, for running:

  - Use console, not xterm or anything.

  - Have write access to /dev/vcsa* - to ensure this, run as root.

  - Use a textmode that is bigger than 80x25. Ok, it works with 80x25
    but it looks almost 3d-accelerated with modes such as 132x60 ;)

  - Use an ibm font. SVGAtextmode uses latin fonts as default so you
    have to set an ibm font with setfont or set an ibm font to
    /etc/TextConfig (those cp850 fonts are just fine)

  We'll release some kind of a 'final' in a couple of days (fix those
  bugs + make it run cleanly from any tty, use those fonts available
  in the terminal etc)

  A version for MS-DOS, AmigaOS, ...? If you want one, then port one.
  We aren't very interested until the PWPlib api gets frozen enough.
