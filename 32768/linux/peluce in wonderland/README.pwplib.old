PWP for UNiX `----------------------------------------------------

This package contains demo-related mainline pwp stuff for various
*nix platforms.

The pwpunix projects include:

  1. Porting our old msdos demos to unix.

  2. Developing a text-based multimedia library (PWPlib). AAlib is not
     suitable for our purposes.

  3. Programming demos and games for PWPlib.

  4. Introducing the PWP Video Phormat.

  5. Creating our own minidistribution (bootdisk/umsdos) intended for
     viewing PWP demos.

stuff included in v0.89 `-----------------------------------------

fisi: Final Isi (the demo)

  Code, music and graphics by Viznut (1998)
  1st at Abduction'98 pc introcompo

  The latest pwp mainline demo and the first one to be ported to
  pwplib/unix. The end part is missing (I only have the pre-party
  source code).

  See fisi --help for all kinds of fancy stuff.

  Use the command line option 'english' if you can't read Finnish.

zaxplay: A tiny tool I quickly wrote for playing some music from the
         old sourcecode. Also attempted to do some player engine
         optimizations but the 'clever' loops are still buggy.
         (depends on OSS and Linux headers)

Final Isi is currently the only demo we've ported to pwplib.

PWPlib `----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:

  Compiled and tested on Linux/i386 and Solaris/SPARC.

  Some problems have occurred with Final Isi due to some classic bugs.
  Trying to work them out.

Terminal compatibility:

  We now support a tolerable variety of display targets, including
  the following:
  
    - Coloured IBM-charset in 80x50 or 80x25, with 8 or 16 background
      colors (preferably 16).

    - Coloured ASCII with constant black background (80x50 only)

    - Monochrome ASCII in 80x50 or 80x25.

  In addition to ANSI display codes, the library knows how to use
  the Linux text console device (/dev/vcsa)

  It is also possible to create ascii/ansi animations like this:

     fisi tty ascii half bps 56000 2> fisi-ascii-8025.vt

  See pwplib/pwplib.todo for a listing of some potential future
  targets.

Current projects `-----------------------------------------------


Other pwp demos:

  We're going to port them as well - at least those we still have
  source code for.
  
  The rest of them will probably be available as PVP movies.

PVP:

  The new digital age of the new millennium!!!11

  PVP (PWP Video Phormat) will be a purely textcell-based format for
  movies. It'll probably use gsm audio codec (along with the
  PWPbeep(tm) system used for PWP demo music)

  Some goals:

    - The viewer must run smoothly on a FPUless 386 machine.

    - Any movie should fit in a 40MB hard disk.

    - All of our old demos should be available in PVP format, perhaps
      even in a web-viewable form (maybe using a
      java(tm)(r)(shit)-based viewer)

  Current status:

    - PWPlib knows how to rasterdump in "uncompressed" PVP stream.
      Sound/config/ansi frames have not been implemented yet.

    - A simple PVP player has been integrated in the pwpunix/fisi code.
      We'll put it in a separate proggie some day.
      
    - Ask Viznut if you want some PVP test videos (including a
      Babylon 5 intro converted from MPEG-1)
