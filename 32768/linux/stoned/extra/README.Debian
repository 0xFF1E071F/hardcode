On most Debian and some other systems, only static versions of some libs are
supplied. This would force us to link statically against them, which would be
like linking DirectX in.
You can fix your system by creating dynamic versions (shared objects) of the
libs.
Just do the following as root.

cd /usr/X11R6/lib
ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXxf86dga.so libXxf86dga.a 
ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXxf86vm.so libXxf86vm.a 
ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXv.so libXv.a 
ldconfig
