Introduction
------------

	The purpose of the game is to gather as many spheres by
converting them to your own color. The winner of the game is the one
with the most spheres on his side.



Getting started
---------------

	This is a mutliplayer-only game for two, three or four
players. First, you need to start the Farbspiel server by using the
command line parameter "-s":

	eg.: user1@computer1:~/games>./farbspiel -s

        Then, all players need to connect to the server by using the
"-h" parameter:

	e.g.: user1@computer1:~/games>./farbspiel -h localhost
              user2@computer2:~/games>./farbspiel -h <IP.of.computer1>

	For all additional command line parameters, start the game
using the "-?" parameter - you get an online help this way.



How to play
-----------

	You can either start a new game (use the cursor keys to choose
the desired game size) or join an existing game (existing games also
appear in the list of available choices).

	You can either be player or visitor. Visitors cannot do
anything but watch and leave a game.

(Check out the on-screen info for further functions and key bindings.)

	Once the game has started, use your mouse to click on any
sphere in the field. If there are spheres of the same color connected
to your own player color, they will become yours. Cross-over converting
is not possible, btw.

	Just play it, you'll get into it quite fast.

        Oh, before I forget, you can change the color outfit of
Farbspiel! Just edit the file 'colors', add your own profiles or use
existing ones.



Have fun!
