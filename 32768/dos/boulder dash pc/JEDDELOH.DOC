THIS GAME REQUIRES A C64 compatible 486 with RAM, Monitor, VGACard, ADLIB or 
less. Keys are recommanded...

The rules are too complicated to explain and too easy to understand so
here is no introduction into rockford, caves, fireflies, butterflies
magic walls, amoeba and stuff...

and ... if you don't know Boulder Dash so far, you are not worthy playing it!

allways remember ... it looks better with LSD |-)
