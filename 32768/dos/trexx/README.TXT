TREXX (tiny not really releasable infofile)

Hi.

I've finished this game for the polka guys
because they left.

I guess they will provide a better info file soon
(at least before the competition).


Just one hint: Please run Ultrinit before you use
this game with the gus. Some programs doesn't leave
the gus in a proper state, and there is no space for
a complete reset-routine.


If you want to play it: Use the mouse. left button is fire
right button accelerate/decelerate.

Shoot at everything that shoots at you and try to survive

(to be replaced before the compo)

Cheers
