This little game I coded for the 32KB game competition of Symposium '97.
The instructions are quite simple:

         controll with the cursor keys
         shoot with space
         Pause with P (you can scoll with the cusor keys)
         Sound On/Off with S
         regulate the gamespeed with F1/F2
         regulate your firespeed with F3/F4
         quit with ESC

If you are looking for a coder and if you like this little game, don't
hesitate to call me. I'm sorry for having no email yet, but there will
be one in about two weeks.
