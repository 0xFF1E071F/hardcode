Welcome people !

	This is my first demo/intro call it what you will ( ok it's only
	really an intro, it only does a star scroller with a bit of font
        work ). This intro is not amazing or anything.

        Just an example of what a coder can do in 3 hours when he is
        bored <g>

        This demo is written 80% in Turbo Pascal v6 with some bits of
        assembler ( BASM <g> )

        The EXE file MUST !! be called NT_DEM1.EXE because otherwise it
        will not know where to find the appended data.

        My next intro/demo will be something a bit more interresting, I
        just wanted something on the scene, to get me started <g>
