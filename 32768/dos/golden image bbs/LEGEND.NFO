   Info file ver.1.00  Monday, February 14th

-INTRODUCTION:
   Hy there, this looks like a nice .nfo file, doesn't it, well, guess,
   it is an info file, indeed ;)
   Just to get started.
   This file informs you about lEGENd dESiGN,  from the very beginning,
   up to last minute facts.

   lEGENd dESiGN is a group dedicated to making demos,intros, the whole
   bunch of  things, you hopefully appreciate. Well  actually there are
   some other projects, like a game, we are currently working on. Noth-
   ing more is told about this one right now ...

-FOUNDATION,STORY SO FAR
   Founded  in the summer '92 by  Pit Bull, Centauri and Alpha, who  was 
   kicked  in the meantime, we emerged from a former PC group called THE 
   CULT. Shortly after, the first release was done. Nothing spectecular,
   nevertheless a step in the  right direction. It was a  dentro for the 
   next production, which is our  only major release by now.  Wanna know 
   what's it called, well, here we go. DiGiTAL MATRiX
   But,  don't turn away, some nice, really nice productions will follow
   this BBStro ! 
   Okay, drifted a bit ;-) Anyway. A friend  of Pit Bull,  Steam, joined
   shortly after,dragging Stainless Steel and Endless creation with him.
   As the last, till now, Brian joined the group in the mid '93. This is
   the story so far, but be sure there's much more to come ...
   
-FUTURE PLANS
   We are planning to publish a musicdisk sometime near april this year.  
   So be on the lookout, that one's gonna be REAL kewl. Nice muzak, stu-
   nning effects, NEVER seen on the IBM PC before. You can't believe it,
   well, just wait till it's released ! 
   As  said before, we're currently working on a game, too, nothing much
   to say  about this one now, because  it has  been started just  a few 
   weeks ago, so  there's not too  much to be proud of yet ... but we'll 
   see. 
   Okay, so much for future plans.Not too much you think. Maybe, but who 
   knows, maybe there is another one waiting for ya ?
