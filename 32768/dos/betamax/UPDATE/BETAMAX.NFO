  Betamax v1.1
----------------

Hi Folks !

This is the first update of BETAMAX.
Only some new enemy-waves - nothing special or big.


Here's some info about the game:

It's written 100% in Assembler (Real Mode).
The Music is composed with 'Surprise! Adlib Tracker V2.00'
The program is meant to be run on a Pentium with PCI-VGA at 70 fps.
All motion is _not_ timer-controlled - have fun on VLB-VGA -=|-]]
For working sound try booting DOS-only !

I only changed some minor bugs of the Party-version, so don't expect too much.
(At least this version ends after the last enemy-wave ;) ). Maybe I'll also
release a version with more enemies.


The keys:  Cursor : Move ship
---------  CTRL   : Fire
           Alt    : Get extras
           Space  : Pause, terminate 'Game Over' and 'Congratulations'-Screen
           ESC    : Exit game

The extras:  1.) Speed                  )
-----------  2.) Fire-frequency         )  All extras have a time limit.
             3.) Up/down/diagonal-fire  )  The better the weapon -
             4.) Bomb                   )     the shorter the time
             5.) Missile                )
             6.) Shield                 )

What to do:  Blast enemies, collect energypoints and exchange them for extras.
