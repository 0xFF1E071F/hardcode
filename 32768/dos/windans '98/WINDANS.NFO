 o. About Windans and Macrosoft:

 Macrosoft's Windans is a one time co-operation between ThunderStrike, Infinite
 Reboot and Avalanche for Evoke 98, held in Aachen 11-13 September 1998.

 At the time of the 4Kb Intro competition, there still were no entries. So
 suddenly i, ThunderStrike, thought it was a good idea to make a very cheap
 4Kb Intro, which only said on textline: 'Wow! I'm a 4 Kb Entry ?!". But
 unfortunately that didn't count as a 4Kb (damn). But at that same time i
 thought about making a 64Kb too, but than a bit more decent. I got the idea
 of making an Ansi intro about Windows 98. I told the idea to Infinite Reboot
 (who was sitting next to me, and searched something to do) and he immediatly
 volunteerd to do the coding. So i started drawing ansis and he went over to
 Avalanche, to see if Avalanche could make a nice small chiptune for us.

 But then it seemed that our entry was the only 64Kb entry and the organisers
 didn't thought our intro was serious enough to let the competition continue.
 So we decided to deliver our intro as a demo. And that's the reason why this
 small 30Kb intro is in a democompo.
