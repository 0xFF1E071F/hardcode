Version 1.1, Patched: 04-25-2007 Wed

 - almost 10 year anniversary! And nobody ever wrote me about this game.
  (I think nobody ever tried it to play, oh well)
 - I used tppatch.exe to fix the Borland problem with init on fast computers.
  (nowadays even new mobile phones would have probably too fast CPU to pass
   that init in Borland "Crt" library)
 - I had to try 3 exe info programs to finally figure out what I did use
  to compress original exe and than another 3 unpackers till I managed to
  un-DIET it, than tppatch to fix the bug, some hexedit.exe to fix typo
  in playing instructions and finally UPX to pack the exe again.
 - and I used edit.exe to fix the typo in source and this README.TXT
 - and yes, I was doing this in WinXP, so I could have used some non DOS
  tool, but once I got on the command line, memories came back to me and
  I had to do all this patching in "old-school" way. Just for the sake of it.
 - took me about 1.5hour to find/try/use all those tools and patch this shit.

 - I'm damn craz^H^H^H^Hpersistent, did you notice?
  Fixing absolutely unused and useless 10 year old exe files ...
  Sanitarium is the next stage probably?

Version 1.0, Created, tested and packed: 05-25-1997 Sunday

 This is pure pascal game created in 5 hours, so don't expect something
unbelievable... (You think, that 5 hours are too much ? Try to write some
doc and help, and You will see, why it did took me that long ...)

 - only 2 players (or a mad)
 - ugly
 - no sound
 - small
 - formatting HDD at Sunday ... (well, I'm not sure, I didn't try it)
 - no network support (maybe in next version)
 - VGA needed

 You may freely spread this game over the world and galaxy as long, as
 - You spread the original ZIP file
 - You don't get some money for it
 - You don't believe in HDD formatting feature
 - You did try to play at least one game with Yourself...

 You may play even if You get Your HDD formatted, or even if You get some
money for playing this hit.

 Source included, but I don't believe that somebody will need it...
(well, You may take a look, how this HDD formatter works ...)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Game idea & rules are my own work and are in NO WAY free, ask me for
permission, if You are that crazy, that You need them for something.

DID YOU NOTICE, THAT YOU COULD PLAY THIS GAME ON SQUARED PAPER W/O COMPUTER ?
The only problem is with this "random" init. of plane, but it is not needed,
if players are never playing symmetrically (causes draw).
(well, this was my goal - to create a new sq. paper game)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Anyway, I did found this game QUITE STRANGE ! I did LOSE about 10 games with
myself, when I was testing it ... I wouldn't play anymore with me ...
