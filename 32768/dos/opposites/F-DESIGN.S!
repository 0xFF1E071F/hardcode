        .שש..שש..שש..שש..שש..שש..שש


        Some news...
        Hippo joined us as a graphician. You'll see his art-work in
        the F-Designs' future-productions.

        We ARE one of the Fusion's sub-groups. (Sub-groups in Fusion
        at the time; Paragon, Fulmar Designs and Radiance) Fusion is
        looking for groups from outside Finland!

        Assembly '94 sucked...
