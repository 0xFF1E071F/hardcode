Ok guys, here's the codes, as no one made a decent crack
for this game yet, and for you guys whose dying to play
it to the end - here's a part of the manual, which guides
you through the copy protection!

How to get to the copyprotection:

* In the room where you start, OPEN the old clock, watch the cool
  animated sequences!
* Walk to the right, PICK UP PAPER (it's on the bulletin board to
  the right) and then help Dr. Fred with his Super Battery shit!

I bet all you guys gonna go like, - HEY, you guys suck you didn't
crack it! Hell no we didn't, but then again, I never saw anyone
making a crack for a Sierra game and their copy protections are
kinda similar to this one, it's kinda part of the game, so
no one bothers to crack it since it's written in the companys
own script language, they usually puts out a text file containing
i.e. coords.txt (the coordinates for SQ5!)

Greets to Randall Flagg, Excessive & Liquid Chaos at RF's place!
(Antonio does know how to eat spaghetti, someone told me! haha!)
