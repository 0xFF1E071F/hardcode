A Nuclear Meltdown Production...

well..to run it, type NM_DET.. and sit back and watch..
if you have a sound card, you will probably get music too.
[anything AdLib/SB compatable]

Nuclear Meltdown has made 3 demo/intros so far:

1. NMINTRO1 [and 2] - the 1st Nuclear Meltdown Intro
2. 0GRAV            - an add for a board in the area
3. NM_DET           - this cool one

As well as some cool games:
1. Joe Snow 1,2,3&4 - fun game to play. level editor avalible!
2. Ultimuh MCMLXVII - the greatest D&D game ever! [hahahah]
3. a few of my other previous works...from years past.
4. 1/2 a dozen BBS games, seen only on Nuclear Meltdown BBS.

and a GREAT ANSI drawing utility:
1. JSPV101          - the best mouse controled ANSI program ever!

okay..now.. to reach me..[Joe Snow].. you can call 1 of the 2 so far
distribution sites...

*1. Nuclear Meltdown - tunsa files - many games - 508-234-5777
*2. Zero Gravity     - great message bases :>   - 508-234-2609

* = you can E-Mail me on it.

now, an offer for all sysops: 
You can become a Nuclear Meltdown distribution site, by calling 
Nuclear Meltdown and telling us that you will call our board at least
2x a month, to download new files in the Nuclear Meltdown Productions
directory. And you will get your boards name and number, and a short
discription [provided by you] in all of my upcoming games/whatevers..

basicly, this is a really good deal for you. You get international
advertisement for a few $ a month..[for calling us, and downloading]..

you will be required to make a seperate directory for Nuclear Meltdown
productions, and have it avalible for unvalidated users (if possible).

so, have fun. c ya later....
