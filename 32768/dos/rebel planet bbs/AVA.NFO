        This is just a small BBS intro, so don't expect too much of
        this one.. .  Quite raster-chewing code too when you think
        of the excessive complexity of the effects.. .  ;)

        Credits for this one..

        Sorry for having to use some lame amiga music this time, but
        I just took the first chip module that I felt would fit the
        intro..
