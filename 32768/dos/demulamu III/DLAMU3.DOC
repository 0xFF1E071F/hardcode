      === DEMU LAMU ]I[ PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ===

FOR GRAPHICS WE HAVE USED A SPECIAL EGA NON-BLINK 80X25 TEXT MODE WHICH
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO USE A SPECIAL PSEUDO PIXEL 16-COLOR BITMAP MODE IN
THE RESOLUTION OF 80X50 CHUNKS. WE HESITATED FOR A LONG TIME TO TAKE
THIS STEP IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT BUT WE FINALLY DECIDED TO. THE
DEMO SCENE HAS TOO STRONG AN EFFECT ON INNOCENT PEOPLE.

MORE THAN TWO DIFFERENT BUFFER FORMATS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR STORING
BITMAP SCREEN DATA SUCH AS BITMAP TEXT SCREENS, BITMAP IMAGES,
PSEUDO-FRACTAL MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE AND 2DS ENGINE OUTPUT. A DISADVANTAGE
OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS THAT THE SCREEN MUST ALWAYS BE FULLY REDRAWN
BETWEEN THE FRAMES WHICH SLOWS DOWN THE CODE. E.G. THE FRAME RATE
OBSERVED DURING THE VERY FIRST PART OF THE PRESENTATION WAS
APPROXIMATELY 4 FPS WITH VIZNUT'S 10MHZ 8088. THIS IS WHY SPECIAL
BACKGROUND ANIMATION GENERATORS (E.G. TUNNELS, SNOW) WERE USED FOR
MAKING THE CODE LOOK (NOTE: JUST LOOK) MORE POWERFUL IN CERTAIN CASES.

AS OPPOSED TO THE MULTI-PART TIMING TECHNIQUE USED IN THE FORMER
EPISODES OF DEMU LAMU, ALL THE TIMERS ARE NOW (THEORETICALLY) FULLY
DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE DEMULAMU MAIN TIMER COUNT HOOKED WITH THE
INTERRUPT #8 WHOSE TICK RATE IS INTENTIONALLY QUADRUPLED BY
REPROGRAMMING THE TIMER CHIP. ALL THE ANIMATION IS NOW FULLY
SYNCHRONISED WITH PWPFRQMODMUSPLRRTN (SEE BELOW) MUSIC PLAYING AS
OPPOSED TO THE VIRTUALLY RANDOM TIMETABLES USED IN THE FORMER EPISODES.

THE FOLLOWING THINGS WERE PRECALCULATED:

      - ALL THE CODE
      - ALL THE FONTS
      - ALL THE TEXT WRITTEN USING THE FONTS
      - ALL THE THEDRAW TEXT MODE PICTURES
      - ALL THE BITMAP PICTURES
      - ALL THE 2DS VECTOR IMAGES (THAT IS, THE DATA STRUCTURES
        CONTAINING THE POLAR CO-ORDINATES AND THE COLORS OF THE PSEUDO
        PIXELS, NOT THE ACTUAL SCREEN IMAGES)
      - ALL THE MUSIC
      - THE SINUS TABLE USED IN SOME EFFECTS
      - ALL THE RESIDENT SYSTEM STUFF (DOS FONTS, STANDARD PALETTE ETC).
      - ALL THE DOCUMENTATION

NOTE: IN ORDER TO HELP THE EVALUATION OF THE SPEED OF THE CODE, A
SPECIAL "PRECALCULATED ANIMATION" NOTATION TEXT IS VISIBLE IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN WHILE THE VIDEO SEQUENCES WITHOUT ANY REAL-TIME CALCULATED
MATERIAL ARE BEING PLAYED. WE ASSUME THE PREVIOUS EPISODES WERE
DISQUALIFIED JUST BECAUSE PRECALCULATION WAS NOT MARKED.

THE FOLLOWING ALGORITHMS AND FORMATS WERE USED FOR CALCULATING AND
STORING PRECALCULATED DATA (EXCEPT FOR THE RESIDENT SYSTEM STUFF):

      - ALL THE CODE WAS COMPILED FROM A BORLAND TURBO C 2.0 SOURCE WITH
        BORLAND TURBO C 2.0 COMPILER THAT WAS SET UP FOR MAKING FULLY
        INTEL 8086/8088 COMPATIBLE MACHINE LANGUAGE CODE.

      - ALL THE 2DS VECTOR IMAGES WERE FIRST DRAWN INTO BITMAP SOURCES
        WITH QEDIT ADVANCED VERSION 2.15 (UNREGISTERED) AND FURTHER
        CONVERTED INTO THE PWP-2DS FORMAT WITH A SPECIAL SOFTWARE
        APPLICATION PROGRAMMED WITH MICROSOFT QBASIC (PIRATED)

      - THE UNREGISTERED QEDIT WAS ALSO USED FOR DRAWING ALL THE RAW
        BITMAP IMAGES WHICH WERE FURTHER COMPRESSED INTO PWPACK FORMAT
        WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM CODED IN THE VERY SAME MICROSOFT QBASIC
        VERSION.

      - ALL THE NON-BITMAP TEXT MODE PICTURES WERE DRAWN WITH THEDRAW
        VERSION 4.51 AND STORED IN THE EXECUTABLE WITH THE IMAGE
        CRUNCHING ALGORITHM SUPPORTED BY THEDRAW.

      - THE SINUS TABLE USED FOR THE 2DS ENGINE AND THE MASK GENERATOR
        ROUTINES FOR THE TUNNEL AND THE SPHERE EFFECTS WAS PRECALCULATED
        INTO A TURBO C 2.0 COMPATIBLE 256-BYTE ARRAY WITH A QBASIC
        APPLICATION PROGRAM.

      - ALL THE MUSIC WAS COMPOSED BY TWN WITH AN ATARI ST TRACKER
        PROGRAM AND FURTHER MODIFIED AND CONVERTED INTO THE OLD SCREAM
        TRACKER FORMAT BY VIZNUT WITH THE SCREAM TRACKER VERSION 2.2
        RECEIVED FROM VISSY/CP. THE MUSICAL INFORMATION WAS FURTHER
        PORTED INTO A SPECIAL HYBRID FORMAT USED BY THE PWP FREQUENCY
        MODULATION MUSIC PLAYER ROUTINE (FURTHER, IN SHORT, REFERRED TO
        AS PWPFRQMODMUSPLRRTN).

      - ALL THE DATA STORED IN THE EXE FILE WAS FURTHER PACKED WITH
        LZEXE WHICH IS GENERALLY USED BY PWP FOR PACKING EXECUTABLE
        FILES.

      - ALL THE DATA INCLUDED IN THE INTRODUCTIONARY MULTIMEDIA PACKAGE
        WAS COMPRESSED INTO A SINGLE DISTRIBUTABLE FILE BY USING PKZIP
        VERSION 1.93 ALPHA.

THE PROGRAMS AND APPLICATIONS USED FOR CREATING THE PRECALCULATED DATA
(E.G. THE C COMPILER AND QEDIT) ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FINAL PACKAGE.
WE HONESTLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO OBTAIN OR CREATE SIMILAR APPLICATIONS BY
YOURSELVES INSTEAD OF ASKING PWP FOR SPECIALLY AUTOGRAPHED VERSIONS. PWP
IS A PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, NOT A PIRATE WARE
TRADING ORGANIZATION.

THE FOLLOWING PARTS OF THE FINAL CODE WERE RIPPED FROM NON-PWP SOURCES:

      - LZEXE DECOMPRESSION ALGORITHM WAS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL CODE
        DURING THE PACKAGING STAGE BY THE LZEXE PACKAGER.

      - THE UNCRUNCHER ROUTINE FOR CRUNCHED THEDRAW PICTURES IS OBTAINED
        FROM AN OBJECT FILE THAT ACCOMPANIES AN OLDER VERSION OF
        THEDRAW.

      - MOST OF THE WORDS AND GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES USED FOR WRITING
        THE TEXTS IN BOTH THE MULTIMEDIA DEMONSTRATION AND THIS DOCUMENT
        (IN CAPITAL LETTERS) CAN BE FOUND IN STANDARD ENGLISH AND
        FINNISH DICTIONARIES (MOSTLY IN LOWER CASE, THOUGH). THE WORDS
        ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE RESIDENTS OF PLANET EARTH AS A PART OF THE
        COLLECTIVE CULTURAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANKIND AND ARE THEREFORE
        NOT COPYRIGHTED.

ALL THE OTHER CODE AND ALGORITHMS WERE DEVELOPED AND CREATED FROM THE
VERY GROUND STAGE BY VIZNUT EXCEPT FOR THE FOLLOWING SPOTLIGHTS:

      - THE PICTURES OF YOUR FAVORITE PWP CHARACTERS - THE PELU
        LAMURANTA, HIS FATHER, PLANET EARTH, AND THE REPORTER FROM THEIR
        FAVORITE COMPUTING MAGAZINE - ARE MOSTLY THE SAME AS THE ONES
        SEEN IN FORMER PRODUCTIONS. ONLY MINOR MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN
        MADE.

      - NOSFE/VLP TAUGHT SOMEONE IN THE ATOM HEART MOTHER BULLETIN BOARD
        SYSTEM THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CREATING A FLAME EFFECT. THE
        ALGORITHM USED BY VIZNUT FOR PROGRAMMING THE SPECIAL PWP FLAME
        ROUTINE RESEMBLES THE ONE DESCRIBED BY NOSFE.

      - THE APPROPRIATE BASICS OF HANDLING SOUND CARD REGISTERS, HOOKING
        INTERRUPT VECTORS AND RESETTING THE INTERNAL PC TIMER CHIP WERE
        OBTAINED FROM SOURCE FILES DOWNLOADED FROM X2FTP.OULU.FI BY
        VIZNUT.
