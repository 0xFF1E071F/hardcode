Solution was founded in 1996 by Freddy Sundin (Clay) and 
J”rgen Blom (Cake). Before that we was part of the group Rigor Mortis 
but that didn't work out so well so we decided to start something own. 
Still we haven't released anything but at Remedy'98 we will show you our 
first production, an intro.       

Members of Solution are:

Clay..................Code, Music, Art, Design
Cake..................Code, Design

Enjoy the show!
