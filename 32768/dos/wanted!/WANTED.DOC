A little intro brought to you by that CPT...
This is not considered high level programming, i know. But for ma
excuse i'll have to say that it was done halfway in school [yeah, just
killin time =)]

if you find it real bad --> write a msg to me and we'll discuss it =)
btw:
      HAPPY BIRTHDAY SNooP! [FUCKED UP U CAN'T COME TO LQ]


WHAT FOR?
อออออออออออฤ

This little intro i coded just because of one little reason. In our
group, we have got only one pixler. And we
                    >      ABSOLUTLY        <
need at least a second. The gfx in this little intro was all done by me.
(Altought i'm not very talented :( )

The whole delays are made for my 486. (i know this SUCKS..) That can
cause that the intro will run too slow on yar machine.
btw: DONT try to run this on yar 286 - it'll surely crash yar machine.
     (btw2: who cares 'bout 286s ? :)
