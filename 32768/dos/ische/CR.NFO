 this info file is compiled to inform you on the current status of code red.
 as there are only very few signs from code red having reached the outer
 world, i.e. the overground, we would like to tell everybody leaking
 on knowledge concerning the major liquercrew.

 code red has to apologize for the low number of releases in the last few
 months. hopefully, the mekka and symposium event will bring a change into 
 the frequency of released archives, as at least 2 productions will be 
 published at the party (CR-ISCHE & CR-ZCH98).

 moreover, the cr ghq is down and the whq is frequently offline. therefore,
 if you are sysop of a demo-orientated board and would like to support
 code red then contact us asap (fwillmann@losnet.com). other contact adresses 
 can be found in really.com.

 attention suckers: we are looking for new members! if you are any kind
 of talented and would like to join the superior crew around then contact
 us, or simply download CR-APPL7.ZIP from one of our boards.
