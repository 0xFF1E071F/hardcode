 32kb game first presented at mekka 97.

 .story

 you have been arrested by evil forces. when you tried to escape they
 realized how seriously you could harm them and decided to kill you.
 therefore you will have to try to survive and finally to flee from
 the prison grabbing a double-rifled shotgun, a case with unlimited ammo
 and an energy shield capable of blocking up to 100 shots.
 but your task is not easy as the enemy appears every time in a place 
 in which you do not expect him to hide.
 try to terminate as many evil soldiers as possible before they 
 kill you to save your own life.
 
 .instructions

 use arrow keys to aim left and right and hit space bar to shoot at
 a target.

 .technical information

 in case you did not notice: this game makes use of the enhanced 
 sound capabilities of the gravis ultrasound(tm) soundcard technology. 
 without a gus installed to your system the program may crash or not 
 run properly. therefore if you encounter any problems try running
 with a 'nosound' parameter to disable sound output during gameplay.
 if you however have a superiour soundcard plugged into your machine 
 like the gus or 100% compatibles the program will not automatically 
 scan the possible base adresses of the card but does only run with a 
 gus's base adress set to 220h and will then reset the gus.
 once the card is initialized you will be able to experience a true 
 code red performance. i am sorry but i have to admit that there was
 not enough space for true samples so i had to (ab)use a picture.

 .help

 no help file available.
 press f1 for cheating.
 a hit rate indicator at the top of the screen shows how often
 you have been hit by the soldiers.
