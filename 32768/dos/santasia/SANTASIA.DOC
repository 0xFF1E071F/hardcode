Hi folks !!! Welcome to our first release, it's called Santasia !
Santasia is Freeware, as long as the package stays complete. The
package contains:

SANTASIA.EXE - The startup file
SANTASIA.DOC - This documentation
READTHIS.1ST - An important message

We hope you'll like this demo (We sure did!!!). Watch out for our
megademo , called Wizzdom. That one will be much more awesome than
this little Xmasdemo (coz this was coded in only 1 day!).
