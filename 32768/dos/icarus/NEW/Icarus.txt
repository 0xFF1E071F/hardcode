1. What's this ?        Well, this is a text file. It belongs to a
                        code FX coded 1999 by KILLER/NEXTEMPIRE,
                        first shown at B걆Zli 8.

3. System               I don't know :) A 386 should be able to execute
   requirements         this intro, but I think you should have at
                        least a 486DX. (I coded this intro on a Pentium 90)
                        Everything clear ?

                        Only the Gravis Ultrasound is supported,
                        because this card rocks and I'm too lazy
                        to support the Sound Blaster, but don't cry -
                        at least you can watch the intro without sound.

                        You need aprx. 400 KB of free conventional DOS memory
                        to run this intro. It shouldn't have any problems
                        with any memory managers.

                        Oh and yes, your AUTOEXEC.BAT should contain
                        something like the following lines if you
                        want to hear the GUS music :

                                @REM ===== Gravis initialization (3.59) =====
                                @SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,11,5
                                @SET ULTRADIR=C:\ULTRASND
                                @SET ULTRA16=32c,0,0,1,0
                                @C:\ULTRASND\ULTRINIT.EXE -ej
                                @REM ====== Gravis initialization ends ======

                        Of course you might have different values for
                        the variables...why do I mention that ???
