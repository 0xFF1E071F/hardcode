Hi, this is Teki typin ...

if you got any problems with this little BBSTRO, let us know, it is in fact
possible, that a runtime-error appears, if started from the NORTON
COMMANDER (TM).

If possible, start it from the DOS-PROMPT.

If you notice any Bugs, please contact me at any of our SUPPORT-BOARDS,
and explain your pain ;)!

Okay ... Have phun ...

TEKi

P.S.: Weyho, here is the Bugfix of our BBSTRO ... Should work correctly now !!
