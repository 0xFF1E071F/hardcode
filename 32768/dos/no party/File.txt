Hi there.

This is my 32K Release for "No Party"
Its just Qbasic and stuffs.
Don't blame me for the integrated interpreter..
And the "music"...
And no "gfx"...

Well, but the Effects did turn out all right.
I think.

The files:

Noparty.exe is for Pentium 2's around 233Mhz
Noparty_fastPC.exe is for Pentium 4's around 2,5-3Ghz or something.

The "effects" are using the CGA display only, since this
mode is easy to use for some reasons...

ahem.
