#7df by wbc ^ ex-lsa ^ bz7 - somekind of final release

originally written in 2 days and released on ASWDF'14 (and was the only intro
in intro compo ;), fixed now (you can select buzzdevice via menu, not via 
command line and minor music fixes :).

released anyway (i am tired of my birthday celebrating ;)

greets to everyone and everything

needs ega\vga, dac\sb\speaker\nosound, can be run on 286 if you are lucky ;)
coded on my P-200, works nice, but tp7 code is UNOPTIMIZED at all.
source code is provided, enjoy ;)

set speaker=none in DOSBox or you will hear a nice 1000hz tone under music ;)
