 The Story:
|----------|
   The Great War (World War IV) destroyed all life on planet Earth. Two revival clans got away in large space stations. Now 50 years after, both clans want to reconquer the Earth. But the ground is covered with mines. The clans send specially designed cyborgs to conquer terrain. These cyborgs are equipped with a mine scanner. They always know how many mines there are in a short radius. And they can find the mines, but that takes time. The red and the blue team fights to get the land first. Only one clan can move back to Earth.

 The Game:
|---------|
   The game is a 2 player cross between Minesweeper and Dyna Blaster. Red player is controlled by ASDW and Q, and blue player is controlled by JKLI and U. You are placed in one corner of the screen, and you have to walk around conquering land. The numbers are the amount of mines in a radius of 1 square from the point. You can use Q or U to scan for where the mines are, but this takes time. You win by marking half the squares with your flag, you can not take the other players squares. You die if you step on a mine. Race against a friend.
