INC'1990 Presents Spirt of Excalibur by Virgin-Mastertronics 10/12/90 
Documentation Check fixed by Jenetic Bytemare

	This game looks pretty good in VGA, with a very nice sound track.
The game play is similar to a Cinemaware game on the Amiga called Defenders
of the Crown.  Anyways have fun.  I tested the save and restore feature, I
was unable to test this program on another computer other then my 386 so
hopefully it doesn't contain any of those invalid opcodes as in TV Basket.

Thanks goes out to the folks from 416 for the letters, and TNT Crew from
Sweden for the nice VGA demos, send more stuff to the PO BOX!
