     Here is another cool EGA/VGA game. They keep releasing large
games with nice graphics. INC Hopes you enjoy the game! 
                                    
     This game looks pretty good in VGA, with a very nice sound
track. The game play is similar to a Cinemaware game on the Amiga
called Defenders of the Crown. Anyways have fun. I tested the
save and restore feature, I was unable to test this program on
another computer other then my 386 so hopefully it doesn't
contain any of those invalid opcodes as in TV Basket.

slow down on the gay sex scene for awhile, dude, AIDS is
getting worse. Not to mention, you're probably a little too sore
by now to sit at your puter.)..
