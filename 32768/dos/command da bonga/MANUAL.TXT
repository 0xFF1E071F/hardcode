  hold it down and drawing then an outline around your desired soldiers. 
  if you stop pressing the left mouse button all your units inside 
  the rectangle will be selected.

- you can give the attack-, move- or patrol-order to your units if you have 
  them selected. the cursor changes in order to show you the best possible
  action. the patrol order can be given by selecting an unit, pressing the 
  red button on the sidebar and clicking on a suitable place on the 
  battlescreen. the unit will patrol between the current position and 
  the selected point until you stop it or an enemy causes a battle
  interruption. you also can use 'p' for patrol-mode.
  is an enemy near, the soldiers interrupt trying to defend theirself. 
  note, that the route will not automatically retaken afterwards.

- you may assign seperate groups (platoons) and recall these troops. 
  clicking with the right mousebutton on one of the "G 1"-"G 5" - buttons 
  puts all selected units into this particular group. If a button is in use,
  it will change its text color from green to brown. you'll see.
  In case you want to free a group just click somewhere else and press
  the right mouse button again with nothing selected. the group will
  be dissolved and the button's color will than changed back.


It's just that simple.
