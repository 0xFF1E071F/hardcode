It has always been DemuLamu's daydream to be the most famous multimedia
designer in the whole world. After coding a few unsuccessful demos,
though, our little friend notices he's trying to get famous in a totally
wrong way. DemuLamu and his Daddy spend many weeks just trying to find
out another way until they see a four-page advertisement in SavonSanomat:

                   !! ATTEND MAZZEMBLY 1997 !!

In only a few seconds our little friend has decided to attend the party.
kEWLCOOL!!

mAZZEMBLy '97 v.1.0 - the virtual demo party simulation - by pWp

This piece of software represents continuous development. That is, some
vital game elements such as food, sleeping, main hall, compos, cops,
bombs etc. will be implemented "in two weeks". Anyway, massive credits
to Nosfe/pwp_fan_section for a lot of great ideas.

Technical notation: for getting the game output via standard output
(real ansi codes) instead of direct writing to 0b800h, start the game
with these parameters:
