                   AN INTRO FOR THEIR WORLDHEADQUARTERS
                           THE LUNATIC ASYLUM

                         Release Date: 29/3/94


Introduction:
-------------
This small intro was created in a real rush, since we are currently working
on our contribution at the Bizarre 1994 party that will be held 7 & 8 May
in the Netherlands. But just some days ago Flash got the incredible urge to
release this small bbs intro, so he pressured me (And since it's my job to
pressure fellow members, since I am the organizer, this was a very strange
situation :) ).

Some people already know us, if you don't then I will tell something about our
group. Logic Design was founded in late november 1993 and we wanted to
release our first production at the Party 1993 in Denmark, but we couldn't
finish it before the deadline ended. So this thing should be our first
production eventhough I wanted our big project for Bizarre to be the first!


Requirements:
-------------
Requirements for this BBS intro are:

- A 386 processor or better.
- A VGA card.
- An AdLib compaitible soundcard. (optional)


Bizarre 1994:
-------------
As I said before, we are currently working on our megademo that will be
released at the Bizarre party 1994. This party is the first PC-Only party
in Dutch history. If you are interested in coming to this party, you should
check out the Bizarre inventation intro, done by: Acme. Ofcourse you can 
leech this intro from our WorldHeadquarters :)

Our contribution for this party will feature things like:

- Smooth design!
- Nice Graphics and Music
- Translucent Doublelayer bitmap rotations !!!
- Lightsourced polygon vectors

Just be present at the Bizarre 1994 party, and check it out !!!
