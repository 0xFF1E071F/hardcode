                   Present a new intro called 6 Hour Blobs!
                   ========================================

                Code by Shockwave Using Freebasic and Tinyptc..
           Music remixed by Roly, original was by Andy / DSX Design.

This intro came about after a little coding challenge in the DBF / GVY forum to
make a metaballs effect. There were a lot of different ideas, one of them that got
me thinking was posted by Optimus, who did a plasma contained in metaballs in an old
demo of his called Deedline Sax. I thought it would be cool to have some 3D inside them
so this is the result, coded in only 6 hours !!

We thought we'd use this intro to plug our messageboard, if you like coding and you
haven't signed up yet, then come on over..

A few notes on Vsync and FPS.. 

It seems that Tinyptc in Freebasic does not sync properly to the vbl, hence this may
judder a little on some systems (or maybe a lot!), in the last intro I manually waited
for the vbl and it was fine on some peoples systems and on others it lagged so I've just let
it rip here.

For some reason unbeknown to me this program occasionally gives really shit frame rates
on some Pc's, for instance on my own P4 3.0 ghz Radeon X300 I get about 105fps. On
an Athlon 1.1ghz with tidy Nvidia gfx card, only 33 fps, yet I tried this on another
comp (P4 2.8ghz) with just onboard gfx, no card or anything and got 80fps.

I guess that the next one will just have to use GL instead!
