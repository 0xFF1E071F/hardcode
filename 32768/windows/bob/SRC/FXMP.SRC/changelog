0.0.21 (bob branch 0.2) - 31 Mar 2001, Kuno Woudt <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

 - although my win32 code has made it into 0.0.22, i cannot
   just plug it in as i've made some size optimizing changes
   to fxmp all over the place. So, instead i've applied the
   bugfixes from 0.0.22 to this fork.
 - size optimizations (removed printf's and enclosed most 
   effect code in #ifdef's).

0.0.21 (win32 branch 0.1) - 31 Mar 2001, Kuno Woudt <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

 - made a copy of drv_dsp.h and drv_dsp.c to implement
   windows waveOut support (in drv_win.h and drv_win.c).
 - changed every call to malloc in load_xm.c to calloc, it
   seems there's some bug in there which possibly only rears
   it's head on win32 systems.
 - eliminated a number of warnings which appeared in win32.
   (in load_xm.c, changed k to unsigned, in ticker.c i've
    added some casts solve some unsigned/signed issues).

<I forgot what I did from 0.0.13 to 0.0.18 :P>

0.0.13

 - volume bug is fixed
 - pan fixes

0.0.12

 - fixed several bugs (including instno=0 bug)
 - added fx: (0x09) Sample Offset
 - optimized drv_dsp->ticker() function *EXPERIMENTAL*
   details: ticker() now outputs exactly NOS*4 bytes
            (instead of SOUNDBUFSIZE bytes)
   warning: using a small SOUNDBUFSIZE may cause crashes
 - removed the old buggy method for finding last fx parameter
 - added several bugs
 - 18-19% cpu usage decrease

0.0.11

 - driver structure is ready
 - divided funcs into smaller parts and moved them to driver structure
 - removed channel[j] lookups from seq driver
 - api is changed too
 - there're still a lot to do with driver structure etc
 - envelope sustain bug is fixed

0.0.10.5

 - fixed porta to note again..
 - some pattern jump bug is fixed (maybe?) :D

0.0.10

 - KeyOff bug is fixed :P
 - Porta to Note is also fixed, but i don't know if the speed is correct.
 - ticker() is divided into two parts, one for tickbased stuff, one for
   rowbased stuff
 - replaced all crappy lookups, now using pointers
