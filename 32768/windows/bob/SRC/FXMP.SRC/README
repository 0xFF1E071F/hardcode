Modified version of Flare XM Player for my win32 32k game.
check the ChangeLog for details of the changes I made for
the win32 port, and check the source files themselves for
info regarding some of my size optimizations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Development version of Flare XM Player.

It's not complete, yes. It's just a snapshot of what I'm working on.
So don't yell if it doesn't play your XMs correctly :)

Just type make
or edit Makefile first if you feel like it
