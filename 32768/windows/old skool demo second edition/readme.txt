These time you're all bored with classical PC demos. You want to come back to roots. This little D3DX demo is for you ! :-)


Technical features of this second edition:
	- All was re-written in a *tiny* way ! No standard library, so EXE is very short !
	- Use native DirectX8 instead of D3DX Library (to gain more EXE space !)
	- Use a "tiny" version of my ST-Sound emulator (ATARI-ST Music emulator)
	- Use a "Tiny" version of my DirectSound server.
	- Data are now included in the EXE.
	- EXE nice icon added

	So all EXE + Data are now 24Kb long !!! Do you think it's possible under Windows ? :-)


Maybe I'll post an article about how to write *little* DirectX8 EXE !



Required:
	Windows 9x/2000 with DirectX 8.0 or better
	A cheap 3d card (Voodoo 1 is enough !)
	A sound card

Keys:
	ESC or ALT-F4: quit the demo
	w: Wire-frame view
	p: pause (to look at the wonderfull sprite !)

Notes:
	Please notice the music uses my own YM2149 SoundChip emulator engine.

Troubleshootings:
	This is a "DirectX" program so, as always, it does not run the same on all machine !
	If you experiment a very low frame rate, maybe you're in software mode. Try to set
	your desktop to various bpp (16,24 and 32) and please report me ! (arnaud.carre@freesurf.fr)
	It works perfectly on my Voodoo Banshee, but you MUST set the desktop in 16bpp with such video card.
