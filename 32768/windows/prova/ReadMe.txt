Solskogen 20 Fucking 12

We made a demo. In a small space. Takes a beastly machine to run it. But it's worth it. 'Cause, let's be honest..
 real sceners don't watch demos on YouTube. Even in 20 fucking 12. Not sure what I need more now, beer or sleep..

Huge thanks and hugs to Gargaj for the synth and Ryg for the packer. This wouldn't've been possible without your
 awesome work.
