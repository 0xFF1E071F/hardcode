We did it again, yes

- . - . - . - . - . - . - . - . - . 

So it happened that Smash sent me a few modules
he composed a while ago. One of them was 4K and
quite enjoyable. I thought it would be fun to
try and make a small intro, and the timing couldn't
be better - the next weekend we were going to a
small party: Durango II.

I downloaded miniFMOD, started coding the basic
engine, and got the little thing up & running in
no time. Time to write effects... However time was
short (about 3 hours each day for the whole week),
and I wasted most of them chatting on irc. :-)

But hey! I knew a few people who could help with
some effects. I sent them the source package, and
waited for the gifts sure to come back... and I
waited... and nothing came. I only had a couple
routines to draw lines & circles, and a textwriter.

SO, hm, at the partyplace we hooked unai's laptop
and started working on it again. At this point,
all our love goes to Ack/RGBA for lending us a real
monitor and keyboard during the whole party; laptops
suck!

The intro started looking nice after the first night,
with some sequencing, crashbug removed and looking
like it could be presentable. The next morning we
did a few touches here and there, but soon it was
LUNCHTIME!!

I don't know if you have been to the Basque Country,
but let me tell you one thing: you should come here
at least once in your lifetime, preferably with a
native who knows the best places to go. We went to

Three hours later we left the place with a smile on
our face and a tear in our hearts, for it was over.
Our stomachs ached but our mouths had tasted heaven.

In the evening, everything was going well, we were
doing the final touches to the sequencing, started
the actual text, when HORROR came to visit: FastCode!
Simple enough, 1 hour to write a plasma + rotozoomer
effect. So... ahem why not complicate it? Well, with
una-i aroudn that's easy: "let's do it in Java" he
said, "I have all the initialisation stuff ready and
it'll be easier."

Yes it has never been easier to miss a deadline.

45 minutes later we managed to compile a wonderful
black screen, now that's some sense of accomplishment
we felt. With the remaining 15 minutes we did what can
best be described as "what we could."

And the intro was still almost-ready. We wrapped it
up quickly, and it was deadline time again! At least
the intro worked properly in the compo machine. We
will cleanup the source code and release it soon after
the party.

They've put out the lights so we're simply waiting for
the show to begin.

FastMusic compo is up & running. I liked
ErJebi's tune.

[I think it's funny that we have written an
intro featuring only flatshaded text, cubes
and circles, plus a few wireframes. Hey SiN!]

FastMusic is over, Beethoven compo (compose a
tune without listening to it) is up.  I liked
ErJebi's tune again, quite impressive!

[tAlSit has been showing us the Mekka /
Symposium pictures. Looks like that was one
of the greatest parties ever!]

Beethoven is over. Fast2D showing. tAlSit and
Newalpha have done a really good job!

[Man some people have sense of humor in these
fast compos.]

Fast3D. Fastcode. Compos. Ok we stop here.
