3GYPT - a (short) demo in 18Kb
First Release - 30 Oct 2001

Code  : Ninja Killer
Music : Kenet

This is my first attempt to an OpenGL intro.
Well, it is more a test than an intro: there
is only one scene, no fx and no art.

As you can see, 18Kb is << than the 64K limit;
now I know space isn't a problem, now I have
experience, now I have the tools, and I'm sure
next time I will do better!

I developed 3GYPT in Visual C++ in 37 hours
(yes, I log session times) over 15 days (times
are exaggerated, because I was studying OpenGL
in those days, too).

It was funny, OpenGL is very easy, and
3D/tools programming does definitely for me.

Goodbye, and remember to visit Kenet musical
home (www.kenet.fr.st) for more nice tunes.
