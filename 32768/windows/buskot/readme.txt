Everything else done by me.

Large parts coded at the partyplace,
transition from desktop to fullscreen intro should be smooth on ATI cards, NVIDIA cards will probably show a black screen.
The GW-BASIC part runs to long because i ran out of ideas (also: too lazy & tired to add anything else)

It's my first production, so please be gentle...  
 
Probability of actually running: low. (well, It runs on my machine...)

Tolle.
