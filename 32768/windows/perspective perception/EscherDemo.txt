PERSPECTIVE PERCEPTION
a text mode intro by Komojo
----------------------

Here is a text-mode intro I made for TMDC 16. It's a (very) short tribute to
M.C. Escher. I managed to fit everything into 22 kilobytes this time.

This only has about half of what I originally wanted, and I will probably make a
more polished version some time in the future. I might even change the name,
since I came up with that at the last minute and I'm not sure if I like it. This
demo is pretty short, but I made some improvements to the visual quality since
my last demo, and I (finally) updated my music synthesizer to be in stereo.

I had fun making this, and I look forward to seeing more text mode demos!
