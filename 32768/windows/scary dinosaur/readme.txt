Done in a few days. Dedicated to Skrebbel, because I know how much he
adores chiptunes :)

Not much to say about this one. One new effect, some recycled code
and a chip tune. I (parapete) wanted to get to Outline but couldn't make
it in the end so decided to do an intro instead. There's not really a
dignified way of displaying effect including cubes, cylinders and torii
so we present you this intro in an "old-skewl" stylee. Some people won't
like that, but you can't please everyone all the time.
