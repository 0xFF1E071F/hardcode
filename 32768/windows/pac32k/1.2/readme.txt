 Thanks for downloading pac32k.

 |
 |  This should be the final version of pac32k. That means, if not a really 
 |  serious bug occurs this will be the last build. There are still some 
 |  minor bugs present, but the code grew through the years. I wrote the 
 |  basic game of pac32k in summer 2002, rewrote about half of the game in 
 |  summer 2003 and fixed the major bugs now at the end of 2004. 
 |  There is still a lot of room for improvements, but everything has come to an end.
 |
 |
 |  I decided to switch to 32bit color depth due the heavy use of alpha 
 |  blending. It just looked ugly with 16bit on a 19' flatscreen.

 F A Q
 -------------------
 |
 |
 |  Q: The game is slow like hell!!!
 |
 |  A: A CPU with 500 MHz and a decent graphic adapter (GeForce-class)
 |     are highly recommended.
 |
 |
 |
 |  Q: I can't start the game!
 |
 |  A: Unfortunately the game won't run on Windows 95/98/ME.
 |
 |
 |
 |  Q: Uh! There are some black walls.
 | 
 |  A: If you start on a new stage and some parts are black from 
 |     the beginning where you suggest a wall, so update your
 |     graphic card driver. I have seen this problem only at a Geforce2MX with
 |     an old driver.
 |   
 |
 |   
 |  Q: Pacman is looking ugly. Hope you haven't payed for the graphics!
 |
 |  A: Raise your graphic settings in your driver setup. Especially optimized
 |     filter settings will cause some artefacts on the sprites.
 |
 |   
 |   
 |  Q: What can I do to get an even better quality?
 |
 |  A: For maximum output quality raise your graphic options to highest
 |     quality and enable FSAA (Fullscreen Antialiasing) in your driver 
 |     settings (e.g. 4X FSAA or more).
 |
 |
 |
 |  Q: Why is pac32k so tiny?
 |
 |  A: I just wanted to squeeze everything in 32k.
