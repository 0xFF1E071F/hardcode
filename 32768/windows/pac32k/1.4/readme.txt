 |
 |  Originally released in 2004 I am still playing around with the source
 |  from time to time. Gameplay has never changed since 1.0 and will always 
 |  be the same. Updates include only bugfixes and size optimizations.
 |
 |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 C H A N G E S 
 +-------------------
 | 
 |
 |  Fixes:
 |	
 |	- 1.2: game crashed somethimes with music enabled 
 |	- 1.3: game crashed on some ati cards at startup
 |      - 1.4: no more virus warnings (hopefully)
 |
 |  Improvements:
 |
 |	- 1.2: 32bit color depth (before 16bit)
 |	- 1.2: ingame sound
 |	- 1.2: increased performance
 |      - 1.3: 2kb squeezed out
 |      - 1.4: 3kb again ;)

 F A Q
 -------------------
 |
 |
 |  Q: The game is slow like hell!!!
 |
 |  A: A CPU with 500 MHz and a decent graphic adapter (GeForce-class)
 |     are highly recommended.
 |
 |
 |
 |  Q: I can't start the game!
 |
 |  A: Unfortunately the game won't run on Windows 95/98/ME.
 |
 |
 |
 |  Q: Help! There are some black walls.
 | 
 |  A: If you start on a new stage and some parts are black from 
 |     the beginning where you suggest a wall, so update your
 |     graphic card driver. I have seen this problem only at a Geforce2MX with
 |     an old driver.
 |   
 |
 |   
 |  Q: Pacman is looking ugly.
 |
 |  A: Raise your graphic settings in your driver setup. Especially optimized
 |     filter settings will cause some artefacts on the sprites.
 |
 |   
 |   
 |  Q: What can I do to get an even better image quality?
 |
 |  A: For maximum output quality raise your graphic options to highest
 |     level and enable FSAA (Fullscreen Antialiasing) in your driver 
 |     settings (e.g. 4X FSAA or more).
 |
 |
 |
 |  Q: Why is this game so tiny?
 |
 |  A: <=32k rulez.
