the name of the intro comes from "Done In a Hurry Production".
It was made about in 1.5 days by scg.

the story:
just before my heavy exams i asked darklight if he makes an intro for the 7D3 party.He said: i do.Later i send him some codes and music for intro.After ten days, i finished my exams and called darklight(on fri
day evening).I asked him if the intro is ready.He said i did nothing.
so i decided to make one on my own.In Friday night i started .After
compiling some blank screens i felt that i never able to complete.I quit 
coding and slept.In saturday evening i started again.After very long hours i could complete the intro.That's why i couldn't go to party.

it's now 13:00pm. 5 hours to deadline.I hope orginizers accept entries
submitted through e-mail. (and check their e-mails :) 

-this is unfinished and buggy version.(a problem with fonts).Sorry for that.Next time it will be better.
