a 128 bytes intro for linux. with sound.
04.03.2012

code: w23 (me@w23.ru)
http://yolp.omgwtf.ru/

contains header overlap trick from lintro by frag/fsqrt (http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=58560)
as there are mere 6 bytes left after all the a/v-setup, don't expect anything fancy.

how-to (taken from blin elfom by yolp (http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=57976))
Requirements:
  - /dev/fb0 (framebuffer) running @ supported resolution and color depth
  - /dev/dsp (OSS device)

 How to run:
  1) Switch to console (Ctrl+Alt+F1; return to X: Ctrl+Alt+F7/F8{usually})
  2) Check that the required device files above are present and writable by you.
  3) Use the `fbset' (install it from your distro package system) utility to get 
   your current framebuffer video mode and color depth.
  4) Run the appropriate binary of this intro.
  5) Vote on pouet!

  If you don't have these fancy /dev/{fb0,dsp} devices, please consult you distro
  docs on the matter of how to setup them.
  If you're unlucky enough to run Ubuntu and therefore lack the /dev/dsp device,
  there's one solution that seems to work: http://osspd.sourceforge.net/
