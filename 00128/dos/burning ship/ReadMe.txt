The classic Burning Ship fractal in 128 bytes.

Screen output is vesa mode 117 with 1024x768x16 bpp
Requires a vbe 2.0+ LFB capable videocard

A seperate version made for dosbox on the compo machine was added that should run faster

When running on a real dos machine make sure only himem.sys is loaded to be in unreal mode

Greetings to Scali, dila, matja, Qbix and the folks on #asm and #dosbox
