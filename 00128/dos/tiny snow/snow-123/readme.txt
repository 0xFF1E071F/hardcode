Snow 123                                      July 5, 2001
Version 1.0                                      20:19 EST
Original code by comrade     Optimized by comrade and SSJ3
==========================================================
This snow simulation is a  whopping  123 bytes! Written in
pure x86 assembly, assembled and linked with Borland Turbo
Assembler 5, this  123-byte  COM  file is truly an amazing
work of art. First  optimized  down  to  160 bytes we were
doubtful about it  going  any  lower. Then, already at 141
bytes, our comrade Serge  has  suggested to remove palette
initialization.  The   extra   bytes   of  the  code  were
eventually hunted down and the bare minimum 123 were left.
