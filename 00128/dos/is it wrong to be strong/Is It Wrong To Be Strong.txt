"Is it wrong to be strong?"
--------

A 128b prod by lord Kelvin.

The idea was to create some tiny demo with music, so first appeared the _tune_, and only after that was found a fractal, that coud fit in remaining bytes of program. That wasn't too hard. The most efficient optimization was "Is it wrong to be strong?" -> "strong=wrong?".=)
