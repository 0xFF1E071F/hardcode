                               FUTURE  HACKERS
                                   in 1996

                                  coded  by
                          VLADIMIR "DR.BUG" MEDEIKO

                                   for  the
                            D.D. 128b INTRO COMPO


There is well-known idea - nothing is optimal, NOthing is OPTIMUM.  So, this
small proggy is not the best too.  But anyway, I hope it is nice enough...
Moreover, I suppose it is able to make those who says that coding is not
the art and that there is no beautiful programs exist to become silent.
It is attempt to put some 3d effect in 128 bytes.  Yeah, I know, I have
too great imagination to see grove of cacti or mountain scape in this strange
set of pixels...  Alas!  128b is not enough for everything...  But try to see
these objects too.  At first, distance between you and monitor of your computer
should be about 2 meters.  Further, try to adjust brightness of the monitor.
The images are depend of it.  In dark palette you can see strange tubes,
then cacti and mountains when lighting the palette.
Now, something about this program.  Repating, it is too far to optimal,
but anyway, I suppose if sWINe'95 had written in the same manner it have been
smaller in size and...
Further, it took 3 days from me (I said "days"?  I should say "nights".  At
least two nights and one morning, when I was late to the University for
1h45m) and this time was a very funny one!

Execution:
Normal period of demonstartion is 10 seconds and this time does not depend
of computer CPU power, excluding the case of too low one.  If you want intro
to be looped, either replace "jne @WRITE_TEXT" with "jmp short @WRITE_TEXT" or
just run NOPTIMUM.BAT - when the intro is being executed once more, it starts
from the phase at which it was stopped.

This program requires:
þ A viewer (at least one)
þ 80x86 compatible CPU (note, 80386+ is not necessary)
þ VGA compatible card (no gonzo programming.  I said NO gonzo code?  Hm.)
þ Pure MS DOS 5.0, 6.20 or 6.22 (other versions are not tested)
þ No residents in RAM at 80000h to 90000h
þ At least 64kb kf memory below 80000h

License:
The object code, source code, JCL file, description file and this document
may be distributed free, moreover, it may be changed or used in your
production with the only limitation.  Its name is CONSCIENCE.  I.e. you can do
anything with this thing, including coomercial use, but you should pay credits
to me (no dirty money :) and don't ask for this program (probably included in
collection of similar intros or demos) cost larger than reasonable sum of
expense of media storage and concernong operations.
