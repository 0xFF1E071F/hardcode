"Hypnoteye" by HellMood / DESiRE
128 Byte Demo for MSDOS
Showed first at Outline 2015

Runs on MSDOS / WinXP Dos / DosBox

Originally coded and tuned for "DosBox"
on 60000 cycles. Runs very fast on real
systems, please use one of the slower
dranks for these ;)

"Hypnoteye" - the original party version
"Slownoteye" - a slower version
"Stopnoteye" - an even slower version :D
