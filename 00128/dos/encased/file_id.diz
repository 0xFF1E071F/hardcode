128b intro
for Function 2012 (256 byte intro compo)
by fsqrt

code - frag

Have no time for 256,
here is only 128 :(

Needs fast FPU, Windows XP
or pure DOS or DOSBox (slower).
In case of DOSBox make sure
that core=dynamic in .conf file.
Runs infinitely, press esc to exit.

Greetings to all sizecoders!
Have a nice party!
