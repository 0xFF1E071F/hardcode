FLAMES-128
----------

Ok. This is a Flames Intro in 128 bytes size :)
The rules that I setup for myself is:
1. Generate good pallete. Not just a red flame.
2. Wait retrace for screen sync.
3. Draw flame in 2 directions: to top and to bottom.
4. Normal exit when key pressed.
5. Fit it into 128 bytes.
So... I dit it ;) (I Hope)
