    vulture's 128 byte demo for #asm compo3
 ---------------------------------------------

    Okay, so I bet you all missed me in the 256 byte compo. So, I took
what I was working on (207 bytes at the time) and optimized it down to
127 bytes, and it looks the  exact same (and so is the algorithm). For
those  of you  who  don't know  what  the  demo  is  drawing, it's  an
infinitely recursed sierpinski triangle texture-mapped onto a rotating
cylinder. Yeah, and in 127 bytes, so ph33r it. 

    Oh, I am  actually going to release source  with this demo... most
likely, however, it  will be messy, but all  the better to learn from.
Well, probably  not. And you probably  won't understand how the effect
is done anyway, so oh well. :)

    You can find me on EFnet in #asm.
