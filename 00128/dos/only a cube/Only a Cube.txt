Only a Cube

A 128b by lord Kelvin.

This prod was a hard one to code.
I was made to change algorithms thrice. And still it uses standard palette
 and doesn`t exit, as if it was 64b.
This intro is more for a coder, than for a viewer, `cos it has more
 erotic codeing, than beauty. Much more.
Finally it`s done and I`m happy.

Oh! I just forgot to say - it`s also slow.:)
