 Nexus - for #asm 128 byte intro-compo - spASM '2000

This is a souped-up version of the old interference
effect (like in State of the Art/Spaceballs), which
are two rings of circles overlapping and xor'ing each
other to produce a confusing effect.

With this version though, colours are used instead of
alternating black/white, and as the circles are
generated real time, they also change size.

Hrm, I had a few good versions of this at around 141
bytes where I got a bit stuck... It seems a lot of
bytes are wasted just lining up the circles and moving
them around in a way to make it look nice, so I had to
sacrifice these bytes, and ended up with 123 bytes :/
(Well, 125 as a certain variable has to be set at 0
if run from windows - see source for more info)
So I guess ive wasted 5 bytes, not much I can do with
them though.

PS: The patterns will gradually change due to the
    changing circle sizes.

Later,
 spASM
