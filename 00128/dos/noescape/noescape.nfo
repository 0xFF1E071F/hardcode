noescape
128b ms-dos intro
for Outline 2012 (128 byte intro compo)
by fsqrt

Simply the tunnel!

Runs reasonably fast under Windows XP
or pure DOS or DOSBox.
In case of DOSBox make sure
that core=dynamic, cycles=max in .conf file.
Runs infinitely, press esc to exit.

Greetings to all sizecoders!
Have a nice party!
