
Keo.com: gumps submit to the 128 bytes #Asm compo.

I think this looks rather nice even though it is only
128 bytes. Of course I don't know what the other compos
are like.. yet.. But, I think this was nicer than my 256
bytes compo :)
I made keo.com on a pretty short time, but then it was
210 bytes, heh. So more than half the job was to shrink
it down to 128 bytes. Hard for me, but I managed :)
The palette changer is very dirty & non good, but of course
it works.
