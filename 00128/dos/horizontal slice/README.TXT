Hi!
Nice to meet you everyone there!
I am Wu (Boo Khan-Ming) from Malaysia.
I am not a scene/demo coder. 
Just join this ASMCOMPO3 for fun.

I think I good only in photograph and desktop design, not 2D/3D design.
I am sorry if my first scene Horizontal Slice (HS) is lousy.
It is a horizontal lines fade down and up effect.

My favourite programming language is Turbo Pascal 7, and portion written in
Assembly language (when necessary only).
My Assembly programming skill is at intermediate level only.

That's all from me.
Happy programming!


Coder of HS,
