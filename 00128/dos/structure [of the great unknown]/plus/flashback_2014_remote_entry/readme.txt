title: the dirt on my window


info: shot out of a window at the
      attic right into  the  sun.
      somehow the shot reminds me
      on"the wind under my wings"
      by ASD :D    I just cut the
      original,  scaled  it  down
      and added black bars.

      greets  to   everyone  down
      under at flashback and  all
      sizecoders that take photos
      when not coding :)
