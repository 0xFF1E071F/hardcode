Runs on MSDOS / WinXP Dos / DosBox

Originally coded and tuned for "DosBox"
on 60000 cycles. Runs very fast on real
systems, please use one of the slower
dranks for these ;)

"Toverdrank" - the original party version
"Slowerdrank" - a slower version
"Slowestdrank" - an even slower version :D
"Bonusdrank" - yep. a little bonus variation =)
