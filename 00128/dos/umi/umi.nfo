;Umi is the japanese word for sea.
;Some speedcoding here, only 2 hours for all from scratch.
;Effect is ancient but i can't find it in 128b.
;And again slow in dosbox. In fact the code is fast.
;There is no fpu usage and only two multiplications for each point.
;But damn dosbox is 20 times slower than WinXP even with "CPU Cycles = max". 
;This emulator has left me in despair.
