This intro was made for fun to show off my technical skill.  No wait,
that's not it.  It was made for fun to have something to enter in another
competition at NAID '96.  Yeah, that's it.  =)

Oh well, hopefully I'll be able to claim the smallest entry of any
competition at the entire party.

Oh, and Joe Snow had the idea to make it exactly 96 bytes (I had to add
a couple NOPs to reach that).
