                    - Group History and Info File v1.3 -


Welcome to the official NM Prod. Group History info file!  Since
I (Clueless) am the official Gore-dude of the group I'll be leading
you on this guided tour.

Nuclear Meltdown Productions is a new group on the often made fun of
American demo scene.  Our goal is simply to have fun and put out an
occasional production.

First, let's start with a current-up-to-date-awesome-member-list.
Nuclear Meltdown Productions is:

Handle              Position                            Age

Joe Snow            Main Coder                          17
Clueless            Gore-dude and occasional coding     18
Esteban             Graphics                            19

We NEED a musician.  Keep reading for more info.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Now that you know who we are I'll tell you a bit about how we came about.
The name Nuclear Meltdown came from a BBS that Joe Snow was a CoSysOp of
a couple years back.  Thanks to some of Joe Snow's other productions many
people were calling the board and it was getting rather large.
Unfortunately problems developed and the original Nuclear Meltdown BBS had
to be shut down.  Thus, Joe Snow's little BBS called Nuclear Meltdown Line 2
effectively became line 1.  During this time there was no Nuclear Meltdown
Productions and Joe Snow simply coded on his own, making many useful and fun
programs (see Release List later in this file.)

Joe Snow taught himself how to code in C when he was 10 years old, between
fall and winter of that year, on a 286, with a CGA graphics card and
monochrome monitor.  A vague understanding of assembly was somewhat aquired
several years later although almost all coding is still done in C.

Then, a year or two ago I (Clueless) got my hands on a modem and through it
became good friends with Joe Snow.  At this time the only coding I had done
was in BASIC and I knew nothing about the demo scene.  Joe Snow showed me
some demos and I was hooked.  A short time later I taught myself how to code
in C.  We then had the great idea to form a small demo group.  Now, as you
can imagine we had quite a ways to go with one good coder and one beginner
coder.  

Esteban started his art career at the tender age of 6 by watching the TV
show starring Captain Bob.  When he was 16 his family got their first
computer and a year later Esteban got the program Fauve Matisse for
Christmas. Fauve is his favorite program and others he uses are
PC Paintbrush and Freehand 4.0.  At college he is currently majoring
in Graphic Art.  I'd been good friends with Esteban for a while and knew
that he was a good artist and liked to draw things on his computer.
We asked him if he'd like to join our little group and he accepted.

³ Now all we need is a musician.  If you are a musician and would like to
³ join Nuclear Meltdown Productions just let us know (see Contact Info).
³ We'll listen to something you've made and most likely you'll be accepted.
³ It would be preferable if you live somewhere in New England but if you
³ have an Internet account it doesn't really matter where you live.

Joe Snow is Phil Hassey, has his driver's permit, and is a junior at
Whitinsville Christian School.  His current computer is a
486DX2/66 w/24 meg RAM and a SB sound card.

Clueless is Jason Maas, has his driver's license <g>, and will be a
freshman/sophomore (?) at Penn State this fall.  His current computer is a
486DX2/66 w/8 meg RAM and GUS ACE and SBPro sound cards.

Esteban is Steve Ziegler, also has his driver's license, and will be a
junior at Bellhaven College in Mississippi this fall.  His current
computer is a 486SX/33 w/8 meg RAM and a SB sound card.

Most of us reside in Whitinsville, Massachusetts, USA.  In January
of 1996 Esteban's family moved to California.  That sucks.  Who knows when
we'll see him again.  All of us have at one time or another gone to
Whitinsville Christian School.  If you're ever in the area look us up...

Coding update:  Joe Snow now knows some C++, and Clueless has learned ASM.
Coding projects:  Some good graphics routines, protected mode stuff, etc.
