      A 128 DOS intro by TBC released at the 256 byte intro competition
                                      of
                                 Function 2009

'Hello Dos World!'

This is our first DOS intro. As vista and windows 7 are making it exceedingly
difficult to run DOS executables, it might also end up being our last.

I intended to make a proper 256b intro for function, but only managed to get
roughly half done. So what would be more appropriate than releasing a half-finished
256b as a 128b? :)
