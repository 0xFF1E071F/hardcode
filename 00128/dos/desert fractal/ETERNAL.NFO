                 ...[ 1. What does ETERNAL stands for ]...
                     ---------------------------------


  Well, ETERNAL is the young computer freakes group. We are the fans of many
different comps including MSX, Speccy, C64, AMiGA, etc. But now we are the
PC writers too :) So we are on PC scene and we are stand for hi-quality prod
of any kind. Forexample I can't sit quitely when I see the DAMN scroller of
"cool" PC demomakers. It shakes & srambles on screen without any sinchroniz.
Awful!!! So, watch for our ETERNAL LiFE scroll guys - pure quality :)
  We stands for people (freakes) all over the world - UNiTE!! We are great
power together. Amin...

                      ----------------------------


  Oh, it is a very long story, ofcourse I'll try to make it shorter but I'm
not sure at all :) So even hard to remeber all. Ok I made a serious desigion
I'll tell you about our PC division only. So first, long-long ago in 1992,
there was KiRshe and BoSS. That time I coded a little (Basic & Pas) and BoSS
at that time was not bad painter, so we did some foolish animations and s.o.
  After that in great 1993 a.d. we found our new friend and good coder - WolF
and at that time ETERNAL appeared. We wrote and sold software and hardware
for MSX compatible computers. In 1994 we got ackwainted with SOLiD - the per-
fect man, friend and coder. He can code on all world-known computers. We
joined not long ago - several months ago. That time we were 4. And last our
member - Malcolm, great friend of mine, we found at Enlight'96 - the great
demoparty. Now we are 5 and we are going to make smth soulquake :)

                    ...[ 4. Famous contributions ]...
                        -------------------------


  Yes! You are absolutely right!!! ETERNAL is a very-very young group to
be a real famous contributor but we already made some nice things to boast
them :) So at the end of the great 1996 a.d. summer we visited the great
Russian demo-party: Enlight'96 in St. Peterburg. There were really nice
there. We attended in several competitions: demo, music and graphics. Well,
I'm not a experiense demomaker yet, so our demo: "Eternal Life" took the
last - 5 place, but in others: 7 place in music (from 32 ones) and 7 place
in graphics (from 21 ones). Yeah, I think really nice beginning. Next time
we will be able to show some new-found skills and experiense :)

  Yeah! really, at last but not least, we are glad to present our ETERNAL's
full "releases" list. These all archieves are (almost) all we did on the PC
for our real own-fun and no more. We did it since second quater of 1996 a.d.
