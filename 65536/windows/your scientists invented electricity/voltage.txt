
 your scientists invented electricity
 64k intro by t-Rex
 released at paradox'2k+1

 beaver made music (beaver@t-rex.org)
 ramzai designed and coded (dblspace@chat.ru)
 some cool dudes made minifmod1.5 and upx

 this thing requires pretty slow cpu, not much ram and a good video (geforce
 would be okay). do not try matroxes savages and so on. they bug.
 in fact it is watchable on p2-350 with tnt (hehe, it is my configuration)

 the intro doesn`t look in the way i wanted it to. i have nothing to do with it
 due to a lack of time.

 we greet such groups as:
 3-State, Aardbei, Addict, Energy, Exceed, Fairlight, Haujobb, Kooma, Neonray,
 Orange Juice, Proxium, Replay, Sands, Storm Studios, Throb, TPOLM

 and everybody at paradox2k+1 (sorry guys, no tickets to rostov :\ )

 with best wishes, ramzai/t-Rex
