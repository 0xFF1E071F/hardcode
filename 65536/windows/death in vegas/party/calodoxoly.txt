                                        a fucking subjective sixtyfour k intro
windows&opengl        live at the mekka@symposium 2001, fallingbostel, germany
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
technical kuisine:
   it worked on an ATI Rage 128 GL 
                even on a NVIDIA GeForce 256 
                  and a rumour says that it worked on a TNT2 
                                                              isn't it magic?

      (don't dream, we doubt that your voodoo card will eat it)

and fuck the penguins.

------------------------------- SPECIAL COLLECTOR PART- Only for the groopies

yeah, yeah. we decided to stop the business, for many private reasons.
ok. time, money & chicks. kinda standard excuse... but what do you want,
we are all human beings. we must say that we really enjoyed our demoscene
fix. and we decided to try to share some part of our best moments by
explaining some secret stories around some productions. the fun in the
scene is around that, meeting people, boozing with friends, and of course,
doing demos. and that's certainly where we had the most fun. if you
don't like our prod's and other work.. simply close this file, and delete
it. and avoid showing it to your parents. are you 18, btw?

                                                            dake & fred

BRING IT BACK
we did this intro for the arf!party in france, a party that was only held
once.. with the only true arf!spirit. the intro itself was a hell to code
for dake, and we really enjoyed watching him doing that.. so, we'll more
concentrate on the party itself :)
our second trip to france with the official calodox car aka "Choupette", leto's one.
(know that we ran out of petrol the last time we went to a french party.
the car is very tricky, it never really shows you when you have gas or not.
it's a bugged car.. in a way :)) nice trip, nice adventure.. we arrived with
several hours of delay.. as we somehow got lost in Lausanne's suburbs, trying
to find a friend's house. (lausanne can really get big, sometimes).
going home got even more tricky.. imagine yourself entering the car, turning
it on.. and suddenly, you realize that the gas gauge was stuck.. and vlaam..
it got down to "empty". "hum". yeah.. that's what we said. we had maybe some
gas for few kilometers left. try to find a station in Lyon's suburb on
sundays. cool trip. we asked some old guy that answered us "but it's sunday,
kids". we still don't remember if we got angry because of the "kids" or his
stupid statement. anyway, we finally found some gas station.. accepting,
of course, only those stupid french credit cards. (europe.. hehe.. what a
dream). so.. we waited until some nice woman came to get some gas, and, after
some negociations, gave us her card. (note, we didn't racket her.. we paid
for the gas.. no worry.. hehe. btw, thank you madame, if you happen to read
that file). no gas problem.. this time. nice, isn't it? :)
ah yeah.. special event, leto somehow followed the wrong lane at the customs
when we left switzerland.. means we drove around the customs building.. and
nobody halted us. seems to be a good way to smuggle stuff. (imagine 3 guys
screaming to the driver: "DRIVE! DRIVE!")

HIATUS
we are still surprised, how a production can become something in few days.
some notes about it... one week before the Lucky&Tigrou Party 3 (pronounce it
LTP.. it's easier) the intro had no text.. and we still hadn't the idea to
put a text. hehe, rather weird, no? as finally, the whole atmosphere is
somehow created by the text itself. hiatus is certainly one of our biggest
hack.. but I (fred) love it that much.. creating some atmosphere in a 64k..
so cool. (fucking subjective). when we arrived at the LTP, leto and myself
had only one thing.. a ZIP disk with.. the sourcecode of the intro, normal..
it wasn't finished. there you can see the scene spirit, it's so fucking
easy to find a computer (thank you lluvia) and some guy with a zipdrive
(thank you that guy).. and some hours of code.. and the intro was finished.
we'll always remember this compo, the prod's were so great. only 4 entries,
but a fucking great level (and it's fucking subjective, again). IMHO, tpolm
should have finished 2nd.. but well.. french and conceptual design.. :)
(je sais flod, toi, t'adores! :) anyway.. getting off topic.
some famous quote by krafton: "cool work guys, you even synced the background
fx to the music.. amazing work.. great" ..we didn't have the courage to tell
him that.. it was actually fucking slow and the weird syncro was more a
framerate problem. hehe..
and big thanks to the LTP for doing oldshool gfx competitions.. people miss
that.

I'M ABSTRACT
we are insane. and we are very sorry about that. we ripped a mp3 of alec
empire, and we don't care. we showed weird cannabis trip, and we don't care.
it's more a wild demo than a demo. anyway. but this is the best example of
what we meant, with "fun doing a demo". for the story... dake was about
to leave for the army, 15 weeks of weird bullshit.. that's why he didn't show
up at the VIP2. 2 days before the party, wednesday, in other words.. he came
to my place to.. have some fun. :) (hey.. no sex, you wicked guys). and
we decided to make a demo for the VIP2.. on friday :). some shooting, some
funky layers.. and dake started the work on the evening.. it was a hell of
work, i'm certain about that.. and don't hesitate to read the readme.txt with
the demo to get the other story about it. so great show on the big screen,
i really enjoyed it. and now to all the people who started some flame about
the commercial mp3 music and so on.. you didn't get anything about the
scene. a prod full of fun, and somehow a therapy to forget the army.. that's
what i see in that demo. and alec let us use his music.. btw. but of course,
nobody cared. hehe. 

LISTEN TO THE PEAT
the whole story started from this stupid Levis advertisement. Fred told me
(dake) that we should somehow get that yellow puppet for the incoming
Arf!Party, or something that would at least look like it. Fred said "a yellow
sock", I answered I'd try to make one. As I'm a poor at needlework, I asked
my loved slaves : dake mamma and dake sista. I quickly printed a picture of
the Flat Eric and added "Try to get something looking like this thing" :) An
old yellow shirt, a tortured cat's puppet eyes & nose, about 4 hours of
intensive work (my sister gave up after 1 hour) and voila, Louis-Theodore
Peuh was born, he had 2 arms but the bottom was missing :) Anyway, he was
ready for partying and was quite a star there, hehe. Yes/OJ loved it at
the first sight. "Let's shot some funny videos". Oh yes, that was funny
for me to stay behind Yes, trying to keep the yellow pupp on his shoulder
while not being on the video, had to nearly walk on knees at the partyplace :)
It was in the box. A few weeks later, Yes proposed to make a demo out of these
videos as he was going to Takeover and it had lot of success there...
unfortunately, we hadn't attented that party and we always missed the
wonderful applause that had been reported...
