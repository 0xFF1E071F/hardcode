this intro is just a little experiment i made during boring moments.
the music was made as a test for a player, and the intro was a
result of experimentell thoughts.

i don't hope anyone will think this is a great intro, altough it has some
bright spots. i don't like this very much, especially not the music.
i can't watch the intro for too many times in a row, before finding it
rather repulsive.
so watch this intro with care. don't get too carried away if you accidently
liked it the first time you watched it. just stop there, and remember.
it's not very good at all.
