                                                    the party 2000
                                          p3 600 & geforce 2 & dsound & opengl     



important

	this is the party version of the intro. this means, due to severe size 
	limit troubles we had to throw out quite a lot of gadget code.
	please get the final if anyhow possible. 
	it will then probably run on your system, too


system requirements

	- intel sse 1 instructions are required (meaning pentium 3 or above, amd
		processors will not work!)
	- we highly recommend at least 600mhz bus and a fast graphics card,
	  but it will run on anything with isse and opengl with a few nvidia 
	  extensions. be sure to have the nvidia drivers installed.          
	- some wavemapper supported soundcard
	- we recommned win2k, but any win* will do


about

	- this intro is pure raytracing
	- we shoot about 10k primary rays per frame
	- opengl is used only to rasterize the quadtree (about 30k polygons)
	- a 3dsmax export/import combo is used to create scenes
	- the textures are all painted and compressed with our wavelet codec
	- the samples are synthetisized or packed with our softsynth
	- released at tp2k
