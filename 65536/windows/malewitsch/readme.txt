Information
-----------

After we already missed our deadlines for Evoke and Function, we finally made it at bcn. 
Originally Malewitsch was meant as a small test for our new production pipeline "Tooll", 
but as the development of Tooll took longer, the concept evolved and became much more 
complex. It somehow follows productions like "Chimera" and "828" in that we combine
ambient music with non beat editing. Doing an ambient soundtrack for a 64k however 
is not quiet easy. We feel that Dalezy did an excellent job using kb's v2.

We encountered some minor problems on some testing systems, but were not able to reproduce 
them on our development machines. For that reason we might release a final version. Some day. 
Maybe.

If you encounter any problems, get a video from http://www.still-scene.org/malewitsch.avi


Requirements
------------

Malewitsch requires a pc with some main memory (>= 768 mb) and win xp (no clue about vista)
                    a shader model 2 capable gfx card with at least 128 mb mem
                    a quite actual gfx card driver as opengl 2.0 is used
