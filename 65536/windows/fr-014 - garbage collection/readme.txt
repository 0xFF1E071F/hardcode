fr-014: garbage collection
farbrausch @ the party 2001 intro competition

not enough time to design or fill the 64k,
not enough motivation to write credits,
not enough garbage to make this a real mess,
not enough ideas to keep it interesting for the whole time,
not enough compatibility testing to make it run on anything
except nvidia without problems,
not enough optimization to allow you to run it in any senseless
way below athlon xp 1800+,
not enough dynamic memory compression to require less than 1.5gb
of ram








so like garbage.
