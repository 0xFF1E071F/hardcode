some words about
----------------
  well, this intro was made in great hurry, so 
  it's slow as hell and requires _a_lot_of_ memory
  to run.. (well who cares with today's computers
  with 256Mb RAM& :))
  so .. you may expirience some bugs on ATI Radeon series
  gfx cards, 'coz it wasn't tested on Radeon cards (i don't
  take in count one or two test runs..).
  as always, feel free to contact us
 
  now, i got to finish that readme .. (sleeep..:))
