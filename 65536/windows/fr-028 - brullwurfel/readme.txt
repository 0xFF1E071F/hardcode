farbrauschs 64k music disk

  kb - ronny - wayfinder
       & entropy
  (feat ryg & critikill)
 selected works 2000-2002

to avoid misspelling problems,
we already misspelled it for you!

-------------------------------

recommended configuration:
  pII 350MHz or more for just listening to the tunes
  pIII 900MHz+ for being able to really use it as a background
  music player (else use the .WAV renderer feature)
  win98/win2k or better required.

  pII instructions required, so you *will* have problems running
  this on k6 or similar processors.

gui should be pretty much self-explanatory (except two things:
1st, the slider at the left is for volume, and the "status" bar
can also be used for seeking! - just drag it):

known issues:
  - sound has some kinda strange stuttering on some machines (the
    player routine simply wasn't designed to run in a background thread, 
    and we ran out of time to code a completely new one)
  - is not 100% tested everywhere (if you have problems not covered in this
    readme, drop me a mail!)
  - it could've been better, but at this point I just decided to release it
    so it doesn't lie around on my harddisk any longer than it already did.
