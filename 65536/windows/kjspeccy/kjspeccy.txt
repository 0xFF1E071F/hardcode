KeyJ of Kakiarts presents: "kjspeccy", a very compact (and unfinished)
ZX Spectrum 48k emulator for Win32.

Features:
 - only 33k, *including* the ROM
 - emulates pure, unmodified ZX Spectrum 48k *only* (no IF 1/2, no Joysticks)
 - speedloads .tap and .tzx images
 - loads and saves .z80 snapshots
 - loads and saves .scr screendumps
 - sound emulation
 - built-in keyboard help screen

Shortcomings:
 - no AY-3-8910 support (yet; I'm working on it, but it's incredibly buggy)
   (any help here is appreciated in this respect -- if you know a thing or two
   about the AY, please contact me if you're willing to help)
 - no memory contention emulation
 - no ULA slow effects, no multicolor stuff
 - no support for flashloading or normal speed loading
 - no support for saving tapes
 - no DirectDraw support, scaling the display may be quite slow on some drivers
   (nVidia, anyone?)
 - might have some bugs :)

kjspeccy uses the Z80 emulation core by Marat Fayzullin and the kkrunchy
executable packer by ryg/farbrausch, everything else is written by me.
