Excuse:
~~~~~~~
  So here it is, the first intro made with our second generation tools.
  This was a HUGE rush, as BoyC and Gargaj were busy with their exams,
  and I (ZooM) got the useable tools a week before the party, so about
  80% of the graphic content was made in rough 48 hours. (The minimal 
  introengine itself was done in 2 nights before the party - BoyC) You 
  can expect a final definitely.
  
  Extra special thanks go to two great artists, Greg Martin
  (www.artofgregmartin.com) and Gary Tonge (www.visionafar.com), and
  to the makers of the movie 'Contact'. Their works gave me much
  inspiration during the creative process.

Known problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Could be very slow and jittery on some configurations.
  A beefy (>1500MHz) processor and videocard (~GeForce4) is
  recommended, with a big load of ram (>256MB). We will fix that
  in the final version. Sorry, the deadline is too near for us to
  be able to get it done properly in time :(
