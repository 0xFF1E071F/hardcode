About:
~~~~~~
  Here it is, the first intro made with our second generation tools.
  (aDDict2 by BoyC and a new Buzz-based softsynth called MVX by Gargaj)
  At last we managed to get this on a level that is something close to
  what we wanted to release at st(ART)2004.

  Let's see what you get in this final: lots of engine updates, a new
  timer routine for a smoother show, texture quality selector (for lower
  memory machines), some new scenes and visual content upgrades.
  Oh and a nifty icon, too ;)

  Extra special thanks go to two great artists, Greg Martin
  (www.artofgregmartin.com) and Gary Tonge (www.visionafar.com), and
  to the makers of the movie 'Contact'. Their works gave me (ZooM) much
  inspiration during the creative process.
