Command line switches:
  -window = run in a window
  -fullscreen = run fullscreen (default)

Requirements:
  Modern nVidia or ATI graphic card with recent drivers installed.

Notes about compatibility:
  I used GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension a lot, because it is the simplest
  and most efficient way of rendering into an OpenGL texture. Other methods are
  either slow, cumbersome, or both.
  However, since this extension is still quite recent (2004), it might still be
  unsupported by older hardware or outdated drivers.
  If you suffer from this limitation, please let me know (get the e-mail address
  from http://nuane.com/).
