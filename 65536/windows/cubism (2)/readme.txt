This was written all the way back in December 2005 / January 2006 as a demo to convince games companies of my talents. It worked. :) Now what better party to release this at than Sundown 2006?

Thanks to syphus for providing the music - without his chip tune I don't know what mess this would have become.

Greets to all in the ukscene, I would start naming names but then I'd feel guilty at leaving anyone out, and I can't be bothered to remember everyone right now. And special greetings to those interviewers who saw this and liked it... :)
