Re-release of an old production I wrote back in 1998, this is the windows version, just cleaned up, etc.

Mainly written so can view it on modern machines, since the old version was DOS only and wasn't very compatible with multi-tasking systems.

All code, texture generation is done by Rajesh Singh (sh0ck).
