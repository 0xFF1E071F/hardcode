  Release notes:

  - Coded at the party place; maybe a real small build will be released soon

  - You need a Windows 9x/2K OS with a bit of memory and a 3D accelerated GFX card with openGL support

  - the issue you may have encountered with the fonts with some new Nvidia drivers is now fixed

  - As usual this prod is nonsense...


                                                                          
  We hope you'll like it !
