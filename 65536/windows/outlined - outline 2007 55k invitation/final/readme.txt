  Requirements:
 
    This 57k intro uses OpenGL 1.1 and requires  
   neither vertex nor pixel shaders. It should run
   properly on low end hardware.

    We noticed framerate issues in dualscreen mode
   or with a few Radeon 9600 cards.
   
   Not tested with Windows Vista.

   PLEASE MAKE SURE OPENGL VSYNC IS ENABLED

 --------------------------------------------------- 

  A few words about this 58k invitation:
 
    No so called "intro-tools" were used,
   everything was hardcoded from scratch, including
   events handling and music-sync.

    This .exe was packed using Kkrunchy, which
   might create a false alert with your antivirus
   software
