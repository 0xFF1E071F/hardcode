Okay. Somehow i managed to do this just after Sundown. I had one week to put something up, and this is the result. And I had fun playing with the textures. Oh yeah, fixing data on friday-saturday night was a real pleasure. :)

And sorry about the music. Its not the best, but I was in hurry. Some parts might be pretty dark, so if you can't see anything, the problem is propably in your screen settings or something. 

Well, have a great party!
