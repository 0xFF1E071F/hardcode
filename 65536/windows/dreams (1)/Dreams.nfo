Technical Info:

  Needs GeForce/Radeon class videocard with DirectX8. Should run without
  hardware t&l also. Where possible, 4x fullscreen antialias is enabled 
  (for better image quality).

  All sound samples and textures are generated at startup, sorry for the
  long precalculation time (about 1 minute on a celeron/566)...

  If party version crashes, please report (it should work fine with nVidia
  GeForce2 cards though). Final version will be available soon...
