 MoonHazard presents: 
   Dispiria 46kb.

 Code: shadez
 Music: ruuvari

 Info:
  I started to code this thing few days before 24th December. I got it finished at
  christmas evening, so... here it is. Actually there's nothing christmas related but the
  release date.

  Oh yeah, intro uses OpenGL, so your 3d card should support it for the best enjoyment.
  Intro isn't very fast, I am sorry about that (radial blur slows alot). Anyway, MoonHazard
  hopes you enjoy it as it is now (yeah, our very first 64kb intro).
