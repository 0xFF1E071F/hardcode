Comments:
Created on a Athlon 1800+ with a Geforce 4 Ti. Should work with radeons, but apparently slower.
If anything bad happens to you while watching this, then its not my fault.

The intro is a tribute to Future Crews original Fishtro 
FC was a group that inspired me, and a whole generation of sceners. Thank you.

Created for Buenzli 12, and to invite you to SYLAN - New and Improved

This is a wake up call to all the australian scene.

I hope you aren't still taking drugs. =)

Enjoy!
