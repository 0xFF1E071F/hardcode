
     pragma  -  prologue
     at  breakpoint 2003



command line parameters:
 -window
 -gamma [x]

you can also set gamma during the intro with the keypad + and - keys.


don't even try to run this one on anything less than an athlon 1.3ghz
and a gf4ti4200. it won't run. probably.

we'll release a new version if we can find out what slows it down. no
time for that now, sorry.



update 1:
fixed something.

update 2 - final version:
fixed synth. now it's fast(er).
