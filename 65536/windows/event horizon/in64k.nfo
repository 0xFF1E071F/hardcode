The story
---------

  About one month before dreamhack we decided that we wanted to make an
  intro for the 64k compo. We had seen a lot of raytracing intros lately
  and that's what we wanted to do too. With little or no knowledge of
  vector math and no good books about raytracing we started. We began to
  surf the net for docs and tutorials. After about one week of messing
  with cross products and view planes we had a working chessboard FD-plane.
  After that and a couple of rewrites things started to improve day by day
  with shading, reflections etc..

  The intro is written in 100% ANSI C, no time for assembler optimization.
  (P3 SIMD optimization with 1x1 tracer in final version maybe ;)
