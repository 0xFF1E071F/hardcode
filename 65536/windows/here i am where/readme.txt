moonhazard presents:
 "here i am where?"

A 64kb intro for simulaatio2 demoparty in Varkaus / Finland.

Note:
 This production is made with geforce 2 MX/MX400. I tested it
with some people and it worked well on geforces (3,ti4200,fx 5600),
but radeons made it look different (too white, because radeons adds 
blends much more stronger than geforces). So.. buy a geforce.

If you have other problems, please email me:

Thanks.
