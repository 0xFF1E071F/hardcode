TRSAC 2016

Produced with copious amounts of iron oxide, deep-fried with rocket fuel harvested from the lunar surface,
sliced to bits live by our special sabre, and finally kkrunched to a fine powder.

Special thanks to blueberry for tool inspiration/help, emoon for the custom rocket editor and support,
polynomial for on-site cooling expertise, kusma for rubber-duck DOF debugging, and of course, the TRSAC
orga's for a fantastic party. This wouldn't have been possible without you!

This should run smoothly on most modern GPU's, including notebook class chips. We spent a lot of time
working on perf and this thing appears to outperform most modern intros of a similar calibre. So don't
be afraid to actually run the damn thing realtime instead of watching on youtube. :)

See you at Revision!
