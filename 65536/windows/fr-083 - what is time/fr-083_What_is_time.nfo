This 64k intro is designed for 720p for high-end GPUs (Geforce GTX970 and 
up), so if your PC, primarily your graphic card, is too slow, this 64k
intro will not only run at low framerates, it will break apart terribly.

introlow.exe = 640x360 virtual render canvas
intromedium.exe = 905x509 virtual render canvas
introhigh.exe = 1280x720 virtual render canvas
introparty.exe = intromedium.exe which should play on the compo machine
