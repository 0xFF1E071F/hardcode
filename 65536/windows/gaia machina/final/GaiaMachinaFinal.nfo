Final Notes:

We started working on a final version straight after Revision 2012 and we had
planned to release it much sooner. However, the unexpected and tragic passing 
of our good friend and third member, Giles "meaty" Constant, the coder of
our synth Mapprox, naturally got in the way of things.
We are back now however so expect to see more of us soon!
Scenes have been changed and things optimized. Music has been left untouched.

This one is for you Giles, we miss you! 




Texture quality setting:

Use low if the intro crashes during startup in order to decrease memory
usage. Use high if you experience any graphical glitches. There
have been reports of block distortions on some hardware. In particular on
text and the strawberry glow effect.






Original Notes:

Cryptic: 
One hour of sleep so far at Revision. Deadline approaching rapidly.
Some performance issues remain and the intro has not been tested on AMD for
a couple of days so there might be some shader issues remaining. 
Expect a final soon. As usual, bad anti virus software might wrongfully flag
anything touched by the kkrunchy packer as a virus. This is a
false positive. Just ignore it. Hope you enjoy!

Giles: Hurrah!  First outing for the new synth in the first intro from
approximate for nearly 3 years!  Engine rewrites are now usable, so expect
more from this space..  see you all at assembly..   word!  ~meaty

Velo: Yes yes yall. Rockin revision like one should. Made the music, got drunk,
made some more, woke up, removed some. Right now cryptic is stressed. Meaty is
on irc and im boozing. I love not being a coder.
