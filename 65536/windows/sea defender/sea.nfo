Simple missile command clone in 96k for linux/win/mac

No music, sorry - plenty of space but no talent.

Requires videocard with GLSL support, tested on GeForce FX5200, Radeon X1300 and Apple's software renderer.
The windows binary may need some MSVC* libraries, if it doesn't work use the static version instead.

Using GLFW and math3d++, font is from http://apostrophiclab.pedroreina.net/.
