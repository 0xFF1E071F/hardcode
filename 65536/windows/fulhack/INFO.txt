Hey!
InGo here.. this is our first 64k demo ever and it took us a bit longer than expected :D
Crappy timing and jerky cameramovement but what the heck... atleast we came up with something.

Hope you all have had a great time here at DreamHack Winter 2006, 'cause we sure did!

Rock on!


Hiyas, TwoD here! Not much I can add to what's already been said. The demo's not top notch, but we didn't expect to play in that league either. But maybe in a few years... ;)

Cheers!
