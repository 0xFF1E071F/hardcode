  this is both the party version and the final version of this intro. the
  party version may not work on all machines, but the final should.

  we did unspeakable things to the music and gfx to make it all fit into
  64k. so if you think that all the logos are horrible blurry messes, the
  coders and not the artist is to blame. remember, he probably hates it as
  much as you do. however, the final version contains high quality graphics
  and music.

  a big thanks to sokken for lending me headphones when mine broke.
