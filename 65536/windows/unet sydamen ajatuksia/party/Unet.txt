  Dreams - Thoughts of the Heart
    Drømmer - hjertets tanker

Sometimes  the things  we want  to say are  hard to express.  So although  the
poetry is gathered  from the ancient wisdom from  the far east they are really
also the thoughts of our hearts.

The people who contributed their thoughts to the intro:

The  intro works at  the moment only  in 640x480x32bpp DDraw mode.  The player
used is  MXMplay for Windows by Elitegroup.  If you encounter  any problems in
running the intro  please email us and we'll  see if there's anything we could
do to fix that problem. The only way final.exe differs from  compo.exe only is
that it has also Finnish (original) and Norwegian (translated) texts.

We'd like to send friendly hugs to everyone  who we know (and to those we even
don't know).  And especially warm hugs to all you  nice people who made  it to
the Trax00 party.
