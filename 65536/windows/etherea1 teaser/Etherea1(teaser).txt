Etherea1 teaser

For some time now (about 8 months) I'm spending my weekends
programming this new engine + demo in C++ from scratch
(using only the OpenGL API, because of the obvious hardware
acceleration advantage).

All planets are 100% procedural, real sized, have their own
characteristics (some are Earth like, some not), and have
orbit and rotation. Planets may have moons orbiting around
them as well. It is perfectly possible to land at any of
them, leave the ship and walk around. You can even see
sunrises and sunsets.

I am developing this demo with a Core2Duo @ 3GHZ and an
ATI HD5770 with an average of 350 fps in space and 75 fps
at ground level, using moderate quality (the one shown here).
Quality is configurable from very low to very high quality
(at below 30 fps in my 5770, though).

But it runs even on some integrated hardware, like some
Intel chipsets (around 20 fps in lowest but somewhat
acceptable quality mode, at ground level).

This is a "teaser" that shows some features of the engine.
