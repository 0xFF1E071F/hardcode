Mühle!
Sodale, this time some very quick-hack 64k intro. This is a very unfinished
version, but never expect any finalized stuff. Right now I'm sitting at the
party and wait for something to happen...and trying to type this here file.
OK,  this evolved  from an idea I  got when trying  to do some  robot voice
but nobody is interested in this story I guess.
                  So have fun and enjoy'n'stuff

Final notes:  This should be  somewhat final  now, at least  the major bugs
              should be fixed. See below for a list of fixes...

 Requirements
/===========/
>Must have<
Proc                >=300MHz
Graphics card       any OpenGL1.2 compatible card supporting multi-texturing
RAM                 >=128MB
                    DirectX 7 or above

>Should have<
Proc                >=800MHz
Graphics card       >=Geforce2GTS
RAM                 >=256MB


 Fixed bugs
/=========/
Fixed a nasty bug that caused the intro to hand or crash when escaping
Fixed another nasty sound bug (damn Win API) that didn't play any synthesized
  samples (including the singing) and caused a crash after the break
Fixed some sound bugs
Fixed some minor design flaws (although nobody will notice ;)
It's not really fixed, but the text rendering bug on my Radeon 8500 seems to
  be driver-dependent. So it's not my fault, simply update your drivers and it
  should work fine
Fixed a bug in the window destroy function that caused a crash at the end
