required
   dont know precicly ;] but it works good on:
   Celeron 333, 128MB RAM, Riva TNT2 32MB - yeah! my computer ;]
   But i should write that a MMX processor is requeired, cards from
   Riva and higher for good performance, also >128mb ram would be very nice. 
   GL_ARB_multitexture where aveible, if not then a fake multitexturing (whatever ;))

about
  second intro, its better then the first one i think ;] Graphisc is in 2 colors, sorry!
  Maybe there will be a final version so please wait for it (couple of days after Mekka &     Symposium 2oo2).
