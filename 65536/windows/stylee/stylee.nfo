         All textures were
   generated using our own
          new cool texgen.

  Started coding seriously
   less than a week before
  Assembly, and here's the
                   result.

     No 3d acceleration is
      used, so a very fast
               computer is
         required(650MHz).

We have still 7k left, but
no ideas how to fill them.
 I guess it's ok and quite
             finished now.

 A tip for all demomakers:
     don't just talk about
       making a cool prod,
           you should act.
