Your friendly neighborhood one man army
Nightlord brings you a pc demo this time.

All code, design and music by Nightlord

Requires an OK dx10 card and Windows 7 
or Vista.

This is my first PC demo product. I am 
extra glad that I managed to fit this 
into 64K. 

Some of you might know me from the C64
scene and the Mighty group GLANCE :) No
I have not quit the C64 scene. I just
felt like trying my hands on a PC demo

This demo was created in about 4 weeks
(roughly 100 - 120 hrs of work). The 
original goal was to release this in 
the awesome 7d9 party in Istanbul, a few
weeks ago. Unfortunately, I could only 
release a very rough and way-above-64K 
version there. Well, better late than
never :)

It was quite an educating experience. A
big STL/boost fanatic like me ended up
even implementing the trigonometric 
functions etc. (Thanks Taylor series!)
That shaved that last few K of standart
library code off of my exe.

A huge greets go to Wisdom/Crescent for
opening my eyes to the option of writing
my own soft synth. Had it not been for him
I would have been desperately trying to 
make a small enough mod music still :)

Another special greet flies to Sensei/
Realtime, for introducing me to shaders
more than 3 years ago. Also a big greet
to Deniz Piri for introducing me to boost
libraries long time ago.

Yet another special greets fly to Spaztica
for bringing me cigkofte (an authentic
very spicy Turkish meatballs) while I was
working hard on the demo at 7d9 party. 
Unfortunately there isn't really a way to 
perfectly translate why this gesture was
so kind and cool without going into 
excessive cultural detail. But thanks so
much Spaz :)

Finally greets to fellow Glance members
for still not beating me with a stick, 
for not completing the Glance demo so far.
We will strike very hard very soon.

And some greets to people who inspired 
me in the PC scene. ASD, is the first
group that showed me that you can make
stunning pc demos and not be Scandinavian
or German :) Greets to Farbrausch for
Debris. Like every self respecting coder
I have been wanting to make my version
of exploding stuff since Debris :)

Finally I would like to humbly dedicate
this demo to a dear friend. Here is a 
guy that has incredible talent, and yet
infinite humility. One of the biggest
reasons I was inspired to make a demo
on PC: Spritus / Resident. Dude you
rock!!!

And huge RESPECT to 7dx organising team.
For reanimating/keeping the scene alive
in Turkey.

Nightlord signs off.
