 Talking pK:

   ieAH! Here is my new work in 63488 bytes! :)
   Just a simple intro for Arroutada Party 2006, i hope you
   like and enjoy! This is for fun and before a long long
   time without produce...

  I use the ATG generator from Aardbei waiting to finish my
  own texture generator. I have just created a little tool can
  create a texture with some text to optimize size a little bit.

  Nothing more to say about this prod and i must go to sleep now...
  just thanks to all spanish scene that greets solstice in the prods!!
  I don't produce so much but it's funny to watch Solstice's name in 
  greetings section of your demos, thanks guys :)

  Tralala, plis plas and see you soon, maybe... :)
