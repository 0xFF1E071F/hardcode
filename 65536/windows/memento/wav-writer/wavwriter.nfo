CONSPIRACY - MEMENTO
"All what remains"

Disk-writer for the 64k's soundtrack


Synthesizer, system code and music by Gargaj


Please take note that the rendering process 
takes some time, more than a 3 minutes
on a 1200MHz machine. The final wave-file (44khz
16bit Stereo PCM WAV) should be 49.056.044 bytes
long, be prepared to have enough disk space for it.
If you want to recompress the sound, we recommend you
to use OGG Vorbis, at least with 96kbps.
