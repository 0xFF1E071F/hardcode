for the background information, during the making of this
intro our beloved friend, that was known in the scene as 
kimmo k., passed away.

the context of the intro includes several things that remain
as a conversation between what was then and what is now.
still, he remains as a great source of inspiration and a dear
friend we will remember in various moments in our lives.

the final irony is, if you'd seen it, you would've liked it.
