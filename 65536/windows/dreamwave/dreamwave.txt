                             - DREAMWAVE -
       PARTYVERSION!

          Okey.. After a couple of days coding from scratch and
fooling around with design etc , plus fighting with
                     players and optimizing we bring you dreamwave.
 Its a coop between Pragma and Deus Ex Machina
                                 and made in a big hurry (didnt i just say?;)

 okey.. how to use use:
                             dreamwave.exe
  results in fullscreen
                                           dreamwave.exe -w 
                               results in windowed, DARA!

                     it uses 640x480x32 and is badly speed optimized

       It Requires Directx7 or newer..... PLUS
                        it wont run under NT systems, includes win2000 ;(
                                             (final will)

                          Ehrm... Shall we talk some AI stuff in it?
           Okey...
                             Sometimes it comes sounds that might sound like
                                                mariobrothers samples.. its not.. its just a 
           funny joke frome Firelight multimedia ;P
 
                               so... who did this shit, honestly?
 coding was done by lator/dxm and he also used some
                                    pretty old code from carrion/dxm (buu)
                                              and graphics + texgenfilters was made by mind/dxm
       and the truddelutt (song) was made by andyk/pragma

                                   contact dxm by browsing in www.dxmachina.org
 and pragma by saying hello on irc ;)
