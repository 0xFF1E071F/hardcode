2000-09-30  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/test.cpp (main): small change to make sure the compo version
	doesn't loop endlessly at the end.

2000-09-28  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 1.0.8

	* src/test.cpp: again some scripting, fixed some stuff in
	rexim.lbm and added some tiles (bright/dark plane) to tiles.lbm. 

	* src/tiles.h: created last animation.

2000-09-27  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 1.0.2

	* src/test.cpp: Done a lot of scripting of the intro, most of it
	is in place now. Also added another animation (only 1 more
	required). 

	so.. the only things left on the todo list are:
	
	- 1 more animation.
	- some transitions.
	- hack ddraw_8bit.c and x11_8bit.c to update a rectangle and not
	  the whole buffer.

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 1.0.1

	* src/*h: 
	* src/test.cpp: everything else converted to 8bit, lots of stuff
	fixed all over the place. 

2000-09-26  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 1.0.0-pre1

	* src/blob.h: 
	* src/polar.h: 
	* src/jeeves64.h:
	* src/typeface64.h:
	* src/test.cpp: removed TinyPTC and replaced it with my own
	TinyPTC 8bit remix :). 8bit should be a lot faster. Converted some
	effects to 8bit (blob + polar/zon + typefaces + some jeeves
	things), lots still to be done (plasma, zoem (eeeeek)).

2000-09-24  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 0.9.21

	* src/test.cpp: 
	* src/tiles.h: animated some things.

2000-09-22  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 0.9.20

	* src/test.cpp (main): 
	* src/plasma.h: 
	* src/polar.h: 
	* src/blob.h: changed/tweaked/fixed/designed lots of stuff.

	* src/plasma.h: renamed from Buzz.h
	* src/zoem.h: renamed from Scale.h
	also converted most filenames back to their original
	lowercase. (living on a vfat filesystem is not healthy).

	* src/fxmp/drv_dsp.h: 
	* src/fxmp/drv_dsp.c: finally fixed the waveOutGetPosition() code
	in windows version of fxmp - it should work properly now on most
	cards, although I now fear that not all soundcard drivers properly
	support waveOutGetPosition() - that's the impression I got off
	usenet anyway - needs some more research some day.

2000-09-18  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/fxmp/Drv_dsp.c (dsp_soundout): small changes/fixes to the
	win32 waveOut stuff. the get_bytes() / LATENCY stuff is working
	properly with GDI/Windowed but is about a quarter of a pattern off
	in ddraw/fullscreen mode. *sigh*.

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 0.9.18

	* src/Scale.h (class Zzzoem): feedback zoom thingy.

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 0.9.17

	* src/Test.cpp (class fx_eachframe): designed the small print, and
	added some more useless info to msg[][].

	* src/Jeeves64.h (vierkant): introduced vierkant, which is used in
	the design of the small print.

2000-09-17  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/Test.cpp (class fx_*): moved all effect initializations and
	most of their parameters and to seperate classes to ease scripting
	of the intro.

	* src/Transition.h: Started working on some transitions, no decent
	results yet. tr_h_cheapstretch() and tr_v_cheapstretch() however
	work properly.

2000-09-11  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/Voxel.h (class Voxel): small fixes/alterations.

	* src/typeface64.h (Anim, Tile): added and modified some stuff to
	support tiles. In the current sources the tiles + palette are in
	stc/tmp.d/tiles.jtf.h and stc/tmp.d/tiles.act.h. The animations
	and background maps are in src/Tiles.h.

2000-09-10  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/Voxel.h (class Voxel): started voxel experiments.

	* src/tinyptc-x11/x11.c (ptc_update): replaced ``ptc_close();
	exit(0);'' which happens when a key is pressed with a return 0, so
	I can do some cleanup before quitting.

	* src/tinyptc-x11/x11.c (ptc_close): commented out an
	XDestroyImage() call to prevent a segfault on my system. i need to
	run this stuff on some other systems to determine if my X is
	fucked or tinyptc-x11 is doing something wrong.

2000-09-07  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/typeface64.h: newline support introduced for Outp() and
	Outp2x(). (newline support will not be done for the regular
	Out() as I expect it to be more useful for writing raw data tiles
	than actual fonts).

	* src/Buzz.h (class Plasma): improved the plasma a lot.

2000-09-06  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (VERSION): 0.9.12

	* src/Buzz.h (zeshoekbehang): zeshoeken. look in the source for
	more info.

2000-08-29  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/Buzz.h (class Plasma ): wee. a crappy plasma. but this may
	look nice with some kind of realtime photoshop-like filter ;)

2000-08-27  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* tools/bin2h.cpp: v0.5, look in the source for details.

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile (crlf): introduced `make crlf' which uses
	hany's dos 2 unix converter to convert all source files to unix
	format, and all textfiles to dos format.

2000-08-14  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/test.cpp: added LinuxThreads support, which seems to work
	fine now. This also includes setting the priorities of the threads
	properly (it tries to get -20 in the hopes that a super user is
	running it :).

	* GNU-Linux/Makefile: elaborate makefile, 'cause beating autoconf
	into using my weird directory structure might be fairly
	complicated. (I don't want to mess up the src/ tree with platform
	specific make- or projectfiles).
	
	* src/fxmp/drv_dsp.c: changed some stuff to make things work on an
	SB Live! (tested on linux-2.4.0-test6).

	* src/tinyptc-x11/*: linux support.

2000-??-??  Kuno Woudt  <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

	* src/typeface64.h: introduced typeface.h containing font writer
	functions similar to Out() functions in Jeeves. Currently supports
	writing mono coloured fonts to the pel buffers introduced
	below. This includes an Outp() for proportional fonts, and even an
	Outp2x() which is an Outp() which doubles the size of the font
	(useful with the tDR font retro_5.jtf).

	* src/jeeves64.h: introduced jeeves64.h containing a Buffer class
	similar to the Buffer<> in Jeeves. Currently supports boxed pel
	Buffers, and not much else. Have a look at the header files for
	info on using it.

	* src/fxmp/fxmp.c: changed to loop modules.

	* src/tinyptc/*:
	* src/fxmp/*: successfully ported fxmp to win32 and integrated it 
	into gaffer's tinyptc to create Jeeves64 :)
