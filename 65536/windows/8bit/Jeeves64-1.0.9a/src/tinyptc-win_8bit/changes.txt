0.6_8bit - 2000/09/24 - <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

- Windowed working properly now (including 8bit version of convert.c
  as convert_8bit.c).

- I mutilated ddraw.c for 8bit support (ddraw_8bit.c), and removed gdi.c
  and vfw.c from this version. (Currently only fullscreen is actually working).

0.6

- fixed up the ddraw.c to compile correctly if its renamed to ddraw.cpp, if you want to use tinyptc
  from cpp, just rename tinyptc files to .cpp and rebuild (or wrap extern "C" around the include)
- 15bit RGB555 and BGR555 converters had bad red masks in the format detection routine, thanks to
  Javier Ros Moreno (tolemaC / Elerium Core) for spotting this bug and sending in a patch!
- added endian settings to tinyptc.h __PTC_LITTLE_ENDIAN__ and updated 24bit converters to check it
- raster hacked up a VFW target (DrawDibDraw) in vfw.c from the gdi.c, now you can select __PTC_VFW__
  and on many systems get better performance than GDI

0.5
- converted project over to use 'main' in 'test.c' by putting the WinMainCRTStartup in 'tinyptc.c'
- improved conversion support by adding BGR formats (BGR888/565/555)
- general cleaning up of code, thanks to Dmitry Sustretov for the tips.

0.4
