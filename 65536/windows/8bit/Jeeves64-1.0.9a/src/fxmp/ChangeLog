0.0.20-64k-v1     -- Kuno Woudt <warp-tmt@dds.nl>

   to load xm's from memory.

0.0.20-win32-v5   -- Kuno Woudt <warp-tmt@dds.nl>
 - introduced win32 waveOut support in the DSP driver.
   (to get fxmp-0.0.20 running in windows without `segfaulting' I 
    replaced all mallocs with calloc - so I guess there are some 
    memset's missing in the fxmp-0.0.20 release :)

0.0.20
 - fixed another volume bug :)
 - added fxmp_poll which just polls ticker();

0.0.19.5
