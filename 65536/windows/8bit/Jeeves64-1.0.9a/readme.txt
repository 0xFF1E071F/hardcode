  Hi!

 [intro]

  You're reading the readme.txt for 8bit, a 512 kilobit intro for
  bizarre 2000.

  If you want to build 8bit yourselves please consult the readme
  for Jeeves64 (doc/readme.jeeves64.txt), which also contains more
  information about the video and audio ``libraries'' which were 
  used for 8bit.
