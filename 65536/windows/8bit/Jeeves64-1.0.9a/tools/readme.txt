Sorry, because of increasing size and overall bad
quality of the contents of this directory I have
decided to remove it from the archive. 

Please contact <warp-tmt@dds.nl> if you need anything
which should've been here. 

(things which should be here: fontripper, `patterns' header
 generator thingy, bin2h.cpp, and perhaps cleaner versions
 of my 8bit adaptions of TinyPTC).
