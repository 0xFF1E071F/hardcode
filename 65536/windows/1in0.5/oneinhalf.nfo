Another pipidemic ridiculus prod!
released at Synthesis Party 3 on 2003, march 15

one fucking intro in an half day.
This is not serious, but music is
fully randomly generated. Each time
you launch this intro you get
another sequence. Just smousse, 
drink alcohol and make demos.

henry: graphic code
francis: sound generation code
jb: fucking code (and alcohol)
