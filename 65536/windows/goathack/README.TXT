Some words from the authors:
--------------------------------
This 64k intro I (Shadow) started coding quite long ago. As with almost
all projects, the inspiration failed and stuff remained half-done.
A while ago, I decided to try to finsih it in time for Dreamhack.
So I started bugging poor Tommy for a tune, and hacked together some
quick transitions. The result isn't quite what I had originally intended,
and as you can see there is much space left (the intro is only 42k) so
it could have been much better.... Ah well, maybe next time... :)
