
dear asm jury,

please run our 64k called "dead ringer" on the nvidia hardware. 
it'll work just fine on both configs, but our shadows look much 
cooler on the nvidia card.

the executable you should run for the compo is flt_deadringer_800_4aa.exe.
the others are supplied for running on other people's slow machines only. 

lots of love, 
fairlight.
