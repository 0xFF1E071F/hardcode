  dead ringer
  by fairlight

  pc 64k at assembly 2006 

  guess who will save the day? 

  the full credits:

  smash - code, design, 3d scenes and textures
  reed - music
  maktone - graffiti pieces
  oyiseer - design, graffiti->vectors
  rui - the head model
  kustaa - the character model

  ryg/farbrausch - kkrunchy exepacker (we owe him bigtime)


  contact: smaash@yahoo.com (yes, that is the correct address)


  the animations are based on some freely available motion capture data from 
  carnegie university mocap dept, which we reinterpreted with our ik solver. 

  special thanks:
  ne7/triad for the ascii.
  pantaloon for testing and some code in the tool interface.
  oyiseer wants to thank sandra for borrowing the computer, love!
  maktone sends props to all the great train writers. 
 

  hw requirements:
  - geforce 6 or radeon 9700 minimum recommended (will run on less as a slideshow), 
    with at least 128mb vram
  - 3ghz cpu or equivalent recommended
  - 1gb ram recommended 
  - nvidia hardware is recommended over ati, because that way you get smooth and not
    blocky shadows (thanks to their support for hardware filtering of fp16 targets).
  - directx 9.0c required, but d3dx is not. 


  tested on:
  - p4 3.0, 1gb ram, gf6600gt 
  - core duo 1.66 laptop with gf7600 mobility and 1gb ram
  - some laptop with radeon 9700 mobility
  - amd 2.8 with radeon x800
  - some laptop with gf6800 mobility
  - gf5600, dual p3.4, 2gb ram (runs like shit, because the geforce fx5 series really blows)
  - loads of hw in fact. and it runs. so if it doesnt it's not our fault, right?

  if possible, run the 800_4aa version for 800x600 and 4x aa, best quality.
  for a bit more speed, run the 640_4aa, and for even more run the 640_noaa version.
  make sure your drivers dont have any aa or filter mode forced. unless you have a really slow cpu 
  we are going to be shader limited. 

  
  this is the last 64k we are going to do for a very long time (read "ever". but hey, never say never). 
  i'm going to go put all the sourcecode and all copies of the introtool and synth on a miniature viking 
  longboat, push it down the thames and set fire to it, just to make sure. 

  rest assured there is some hardcore technology in this (particularly in the animation department). we 
  pretty much stretched it to the limit in every way we could. 

  and finally.. we know that our productions are not a lot of sceners "cup of tea". it appears that 
  many people expect certain things from a demo, which are also the things that i personally hate. soo,
  if it's not your cup of tea.. i dont give a shit! your tea fucking sucks ass anyway! =)
