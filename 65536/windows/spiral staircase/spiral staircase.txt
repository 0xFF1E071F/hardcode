	conqui		code
	mnemonix	code and music

	tested on celeron 400 with tnt2 m64 graphics adapter
	developed on athlon 1000 with gf2mx graphics adapter

	we didn't feel like bug fixing anything at the moment
	maybe somewhere in the future.

	second place at woest'02

	for the sake of clarity:
	requires msvcr70.dll
	don't start complaining that using dll's in 64k intros is lame
	if you do, you don't have ANY idea about what you are saying !
