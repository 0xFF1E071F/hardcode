Abyss presents 2dfxHD - FullHD 64KB intro remix of my MS98 demo 2dfx,
proud to use software rendering and AHX in 2016 ;-)

Comments:
Finally this thing fits inside 64KB and uses AHX player as it should have
been in '98 and instead of 320x200 it now renders in 1920x1080 ;-)

Found some nasty behaviour of OpenMP in VS2013 during development,
so run 2dfx_powersaving.bat as a workaround.
JSYK: "_putenv_s("OMP_WAIT_POLICY", "PASSIVE");" is too late :-(
