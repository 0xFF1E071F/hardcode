 This version  the final version.  We worked hard during more  than a month to optimize
the music synthetizer,  that was just fucking the Pentium 4 caches,  branch  prediction 
and all that waste of silicon. We didn't notice the problem until the deadline  because
we  were basically testing on AMD and MACs.  Now, it  takes  about 3 times less precalc
time, so hopefully you can watch the intro without going to take a coffe while loading. 
The precomputation bottleneck is  now on the graphics card,  so you will  need a Radeon 
9600 at  least to load the intro quickly.  You also need that kind of graphics  card to 
smoothly see the rendering, anyway. Forget about NV FX5?00...  and even in GeForce 6600 
it  doesn't  run that smoothly.  We recomend  Radeon 9800 at least.  No floating  point 
textures,  glsl or frame buffer objects are needed,  so it should run in quite standard
configurations; just "plain" opengl is used, plus pixel shaders 2.

 We also  improved the sound quality, and also some minor visual details. All this work
just to make you happy.
