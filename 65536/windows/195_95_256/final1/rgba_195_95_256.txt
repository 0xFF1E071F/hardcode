 This version  the final version.  We worked hard during more  than a month to optimize
the music synthetizer,  that was just jucking the Pentium 4 caches,  branch  prediction 
and all that waste of sillicon. We didn't notice the problem until the deadline because
we  were basically testing on AMD and MACs.  Now, it  takes  about 3 times less precalc
time, so hopefully you can watch the intro without going to take a coffe while loading. 
The precomputation bottleneck is  know on the graphics card,  so you will need a Radeon 
9600 at  least to load the intro quickly.  You also need that kind of graphics  card to 
smoothly see the rendering, anyway. Forgat about NV FX5?00.

 We also  improved the sound quality, and also some minor visual details.  All to make 
you happy.
