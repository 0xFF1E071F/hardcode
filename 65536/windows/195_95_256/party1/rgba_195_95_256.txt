Notes:

- This version is QUITE BUGGY. Cross your fingers: if it works, ok,
  if not, please wait for a bugfixed version :). We hope it doesn't crash 
  on the compo machine.

- Precalc is VERY slow, please be patient

- We suck, we know.

- Final and smaller version will come. This time, it will come ;)
