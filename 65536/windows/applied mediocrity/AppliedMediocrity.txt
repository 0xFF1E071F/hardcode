Kakiarts: "Applied Mediocrity"
a 64k intro for Evoke 2009

code&gfx: KeyJ
music:    Tristan

This small collection of effects requires a Shader Model 4.0 capable graphics
card, due to some Vertex Texture Fetch abuse. It has been developed and tested
mainly on nVidia hardware, but it should work on ATI as well.
If there are framerate stuttering issues on nVidia cards, try to disable
"multithreaded optimizations" in the driver.
For ATI, Catalyst 9.5 or newer is required.

Uses the good old V2 synthesizer system by Farbrausch.


PS: This might be our last bigger PC intro/demo for a long time -- but never
    say never ... ;)
