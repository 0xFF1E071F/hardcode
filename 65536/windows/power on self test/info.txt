Released at Stream MEGA 2005.

(party version - there may be a final version
 if something needs to be fixed)




* Usage:
- Turn off "vertex shader 1.1" if you happen
  to run it on something without vertex shaders
  (eg. GeForce2 or GeForce4MX).


* Requirements:
- DirectX 9.0c (version from December 2004 or newer)

- GeForce2-class card is really minimum, but
  it can produce rendering bugs. GeForce3-class
  card or better is strongly suggested.

- Some rendering bugs can also show up on
  certain versions of drivers used with
  certain gfx cards. Newest drivers should
  work best.

- Good CPU/GFX card won't hurt.
