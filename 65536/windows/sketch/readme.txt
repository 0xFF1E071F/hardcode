Some words from the authors:
----------------------------

Supposed to be released at The Party 99, however, we didnt make it to the deadline.
It might be a bit slow on older computers (i.e. under 800 Mhz) due to the
realtime softsynth which takes a considerable amount of CPU resources.

If you would like to contact us, go right ahead:
