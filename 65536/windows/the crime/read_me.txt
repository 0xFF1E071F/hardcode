              Useless words:
             ----------------

  No Z-Buffer can store Dostoevsky's depth,
  it's good time to read the original book
     (and blame us, keeping in mind
       it's our first production).

    As we call it an intro (64K demo),
            it's time to add

        Final version addition:
       -------------------------

 After all the parties I had extra time
 to work on the intro quietly and bring
 it closer to what I wanted it to be.
 There's always a point, when one has to
                STOP.


         God save the Scene!
