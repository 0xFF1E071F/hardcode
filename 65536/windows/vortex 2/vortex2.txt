kakiarts: vortex 2

a crappy 64k intro for Evoke 2008
made in a few days without any real concept

100% hand-coded, no fancy tools 'n stuff used,
except the V2 synthesizer system by kb/fr and
the kkrunchy executable packer by ryg/fr

requires a moderately fast graphics card with
shader model 2.0;
might have some display issues on ATI Radeon
9x00 chips

code, graphics: KeyJ
music: tristan
artistic support: SubC
