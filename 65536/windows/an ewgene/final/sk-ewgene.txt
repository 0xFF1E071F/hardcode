 yes, spinning kids are quite active this year,
 and you don't know why. We neither, but we are 
 looking for good theories  (please let us know 
 as soon as you have one).    Meanwhile you can 
 have a look to our new production.

 The production have been done in complete 
 laziness, I started to code it just after MS
 2002
 
 let's point out the credits:
 code  : pan
 design: pan
 music : dixan

 hints : mao, crises, drift, rio

 bugfixing: FooLman/United Force

 and then some dues:
 firelight multimedia for fmod music system
 m. oberhumer & l. molnar for UPX packer
 some random websites, for the paranoid.
 
 now, get some notes to contact us:

 The hidden part is as hidden as the one on PK.

 at the greetings.
 
 Rougly, the people we would like to greet are:

   Calodox
   Droid

 We are not greeting Kewlers, because they're

 of Mewlers.
