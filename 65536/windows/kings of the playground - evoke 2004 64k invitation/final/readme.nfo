              EVOKE 2004 64k invitation

                     by Equinox 

        (Released at Scene Event - July 2004)

 --------------------------------------------------- 

  Credits:

      Keops          code, design, 3D, animation

      Nova        end picture, additional design

      Reed                                 music 

 --------------------------------------------------- 
 
  Requirements:

   * 3D card with OpenGL 1.1 support
   * P3 500
   * GeForce 2MX class card

  Important:

   PLEASE MAKE SURE OPENGL VSYNC IS ENABLED

   (or at least application-controlled) in your
   drivers settings or else the motion might look
   very jerky and the image will shear due to the
   regular speed movements.

   Best experienced with at least a Geforce 2 or a
   radeon 9500. Below this card class, Multisample
   (antialiasing) will not be available and the
   rendering  will look somewhat blocky because of
   the high image contrast.

   If you encounter graphic glitches (especially
   with gf4mx), try to update your drivers.

   Once the EVOKE logo is spinning, press some keys
   to get the hidden texts

  A few words about this 64k invitation:

   No so called "intro-tools" were used, everything
   is hardcoded from scratch, including scripting,
   music-sync, and animation steps.
   
   Music, made by our disco guest Reed, is a 65kb
   xm (30kb packed), no softsynth.

   The basic idea was to stick to the original
   EVOKE logo made by Pandur/Black Maiden and work
   around this theme.
