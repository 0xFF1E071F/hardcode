the requirements
----------------

fast gfx card (geforce2 or better) would be nice
fast processor (duron 600 or better) would be nice
insane amounts of memory (256mb or more; i'll fix it, promise; no time right now tho)
64kb of disk space
5 minutes of patience

the intro
---------

it was mainly done by cp and wayfinder in a timeframe of about 3
weeks before (and including) mekka & symposium 2002, and my only
real involvement was in giving them the tools and doing some debugging.

let's say i'm at the very least surprised by the quality of the results. anyway,
it's fun, and congratulations on your great work, mates! definitely looking
forward to what you'll conceive next, and way, your tune rocks.

the technology
--------------

not much to say here.. basically, just like fr-013; my very own version of an intro
system (refer to www.theproduct.de for another, more famous, example of that kind :)
with some bugs fixed from the fr-013 versions and some things i'd better start fixing
right now. this definitely includes memory management/requirements; 16bits per color
channel rock for intermediate results because the increased precision really gives
the artist a lot more freedom, but the increased texture sizes is quite a price too.
i'll explore a possible 8bit version after the party though.

trivia
------

this is the first time the vast majority of persons involved here ever finished a demo
(intro) before the deadline. all cheer. thanks.
