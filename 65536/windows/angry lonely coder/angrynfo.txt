This is a fixed version of the intro released at the edison 2011 party,
The party/compo version had a severe bug that caused the synth to
get more or less random inputs that in turn caused the music to
sound very very bad, also some small fixes like hiding the cursor and
pre-calculating the song instead of using dual-cores. (A small delay
at startup for lower overall machine requirements)

The old version is also provided in the old_compo subdir for reference
for those that wishes to hear the calamity.

Speaking of the music it was the reason for the name of this intro,
since it's composed by a musically handicapped coder it certainly isn't
a masterpiece but in some ways it was needed.

The sunday before the edison party a certain unnamed musician whom
i've done some old intros with told me that his old music was bad and
didn't want me to use any of the old tunes. Said and done i decided that
it was time for me to make the music myself for once. Partly to learn
and get a softsynth done, partly to make sure that i don't have to do it
again by providing bad enough music (funnily enough the softsynth bug
sure as hell helped in that latter objective but once you've made music
you don't really see the fun part of the music being destroyed).

Some notes:
- kkrunchy used to pack the intro.
- the entire softsynth was coded from scratch during the week
- the "old" 3dengine from "kontroll" was used again to make hopefully
   it's last appearance (albeit this time with some more features used).
- the graphics was originally mostly made for another demo
   and simplified to fit into the 64k.
   (But maybe too much since i had over 5k left when i was "finished")
