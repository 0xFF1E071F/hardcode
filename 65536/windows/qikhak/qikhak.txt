100% party coding

100% buenzli

we started this little thingy less than 2 hours before deadline
so we didn't have any time to do the sync. sorry!

music was done with milkytracker on nula's pocket pc.

we send our greetings to all people at buenzli (including
organizers, YES! :) you're all great!

special greet from nula goes to redox for giving me both
his GUS babies.
