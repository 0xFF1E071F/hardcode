þ	We rushed to get this thing ready in time. If the compo wasn't delayed for
	two hours or so we probably wouldn't have made it. The credz go a little
	like this:

þ	some 3d hardcoded modelling code by Inopia
	system code and effects by Snq
	other effect code by Ile
	same goes for Rob
	music by Crystal Score/TBL (a.k.a. boor)
	player by Balance/TBL (THANK YOU)
	textures by Oyise

þ	Humble thanks to nix for providing us with beer. We like you.
	To 3state we would only like to say: you are 0xDEADBEEF.

þ	This thing is windows + openGL, so you know which helpdesks to contact. If
	anything should fail, blame the guy with the glasses.

þ	oh yeah: the greetz might be incomplete too. I hope the people we forgot
	still love us and don't flame us for forgetting them.

þ	aardbei out
