cashcow runs under windows only, and there will never be a dos
version, since dos belongs in a museum ;)

i have absolutely no clue how much mem it needs, but i think
32megs should be more than enough.
this thing was coded on a p2-450 with 128 megs and a tnt2, and
it runs fine on that (doh),  it also ran smooth at a p2-400 with
a tnt, and i haven't been able to test it on anything slower,
except for a p90 with 96megs and a dx2/75 laptop with 16megs and
a 640x480x256 res, and yes, it actually worked on those two ;)
i think it should run pretty well on anything above 300mhz. 
this slowness is of course not my own fault,  but windows' =)
oh, it probably won't run under NT.. sorry for that, but i dont
have an NT machine available, i will install it soon tho, and if
enough people (1 or more hehe) ask for an NT version, i will
fire up the debugger and find the fuckin bug!

okay, some useful things:
- put a star (*) somewhere in your commandline, and the textures
  that are generated will be saved to disk. if the textures are
  already present, they will be loaded, so they dont have to be 
  calculated again and again..
- put a "w" in the commandline to run the intro in a window.
  you can switch fullscreen/windowed during the intro by pressing
  alt+enter. if you don't have a 512x384 fullscreen mode, you
  will be windowed, and of course this alt+enter shortkey wont
  work :)
- press esc or alt+f4 at any time to quit the intro right away
- press alt for pause ;)
- press alt-prntscrn for a screenshot

  by now :) i can tell you that i spent more time on it than

okay enough of that.

if for some reason, the intro won't run.. feel free to tell me
about it, so we can release a fix for that, and also have your
problem fixed in future productions. any comments are welcome
