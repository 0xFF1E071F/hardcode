these new exes will also run under NT or 2000


updates in this version:
- fixed several "bugs", some were kind of obvious, others were a total mystery to me...
  but it runs now, under my w2000. if it doesn't work under NT i'll hear soon enough :)
- the exe got smaller for some reason, but i dont remember removing stuff, only adding?
- some MAJOR speedups if you have MMX
if you find more bugs, let me know: snq@scene.org


note to other coders:
use MMX wherever you can, the texgen is 4 times faster now only because it uses MMX!
it makes a hell of a difference! (ask ile and rob if you won't take it from me :)
