info
  this is the party version of the intro. it may or may not work (probably not).

  as always, it's ours, not yours, although you can copy it for free. no making money on
  our "work" unless you talk to us first. we are irresponsible persons that are not
  to blame if your computer blows up (but we don't expect it to)
