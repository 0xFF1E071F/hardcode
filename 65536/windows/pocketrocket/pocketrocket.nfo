Pocketrocket - An intro in 40kb
by mrwb

Placed #3 at TG07.

This is my first try at an intro,
and also my first solo-prod.

It has a few bugs on some systems
(not 100% vista compatible).

The music is also very poorly mastered,
mastering at the party place is a baaad idea.

The intro uses kkrunchy by ryg, 
and V2 by kb.
