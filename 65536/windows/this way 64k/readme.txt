      ·Additional Notes                                     ·


           This  is  a  64k  version  of  our demo  This Way
           released at the Euskal Party 10.
           It all started as a challenge KILE  suggested  to
           the group, a bit before the Euskal 12.  As we all
           were  quite busy at that moment  we decided  we'd
           rather  try  to release  it at  BCNParty the same
           year,so the development actually started a couple
           of weeks before that party.
           We  managed  to make an  almost finished version,
           but it still lacked some details and optimizations
           so once again we had no production for BCN.
           Some days before ifparty we got enough motivation
           to finish the rest and here's the result.
           It's more like a test for us rather than a serious
           prod, we wanted to know if we were able to make a
           more or less similar version in 64k. Doing a
           very reduced version of an existant work,  making
           no  specific  tools  for it was probably the main
           challenge.   As we focused on making it look like
           the  original  one,  the  ugly scenes will remain
           ugly, and the very few nice details will remain...
           well, nice hopefully.
           KILE also joins Stravaganza as a new member, he's
           quite a talented coder and  also  has been a very
           good friend in and outside the scene for a while
           now, which we consider is the most important thing.
           He did an amazing job trying to get the intro done
           so lots of respects to him.
           Hopefully we'll be doing more works together in
           the future, so stay tuned.
           Oh and ifparty will probably rock :)
