For full Pleasure you should use a decent GFX-card. It was successfully testet on a GF2. 

Facts:

- Resolution: 800x600/32Bit
- Features _no_ memory-management
- Music was a VERY quick hack, live on the party 
- Complete 'design'-code was done on party aswell
- YES, we were too tired to do proper timing of the fx
