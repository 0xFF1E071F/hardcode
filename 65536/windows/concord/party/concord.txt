Concord by Ümlaüt Design

Made for Experience 2013


Needs shader 3.0 and d3dx9_43.dll


The intro is, in a large part, generative; 
feel free to play around with the random seed.

To that end, video rendering of this intro
is explicitly forbidden.

Big thanks to Leia, Reid, Tomoya, Smash, 
and especially Statix for reinvigorating
my interest in generative visuals.
