             The crowd is always ready to help tear down a successfull group.

             Who were we that we should succeed where so many others failed ?
             Ofcourse,there was something wrong,some dark evil mystery or we
             never should have succeeded. Fact is, when releaseday comes, we
             don't pussy out like the rest of you.

             Trust us to use our power wisely,like the kind benevolent leaders
             that we are. We're so far out, it's dark here.
