CONSPIRACY - SATURDAY NIGHT SCENER
Disk-writer for the 64k's soundtrack


Music by Vincenzo
Synthesizer and system code by Gargaj



Please take note that the rendering process 
takes some time, more than a minute and a half
on a 1200MHz machine. The final wave-file (44khz
16bit Stereo PCM WAV) should be 40.116.396 bytes
long, be prepared to have enough disk
space for it.
If you want to recompress the sound, we recommend you
to use OGG Vorbis, at least with 96kbps.

Have fun!
