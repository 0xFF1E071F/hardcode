boring tech info follows..

three performances on the bill:
(setup dialogs are for lamers who dont fill their free space with nice 2d graphics)

flt_meetthefamily_128.exe 
- 800x600, 4xmultisample, 512x512 shadowmaps. use this version for all the shit cards out there, although i really hope nobody with a 
geforce 5xxx series card tries to run it, it'll be a slideshow.
also use it for nvidia 6xxx series - they support filtering fp16 textures, so the shadowmaps work fine at this res here. 

flt_meetthefamily_256.exe 
- same as above but 1024x1024 shadowmaps. use this for ATI cards, as they dont support fp16 texture filtering. (apparently ati dont
consider it useful)

flt_meetthefamily_512.exe
- 1024x768, double size rendertargets everywhere. it's the compoversion, because they have a massive system that doesnt
have fp16 texture filtering, so we compensated with huge shadowmaps. probably doesnt work on anything else.


requires DirectX 9.0c, pixelshader+vertexshader 2.0, floating point rendertarget support, and 4x multisampling.



tested on:
- geforce 6600gt 128, p4 3.0, 1024mb, runs perfectly fine
- geforce 5700 p4 3.2 2gb, it was a slideshow, dont bother
- radeon x800, athlon 2500, runs perfectly fine
- geforce 7900, p4 something stupid, 2gb, runs fine (no kidding)
- radeon 9800 etc etc, works fine
- ati firegl 3100 blah, fine but slow
