We  did the  trick again.  Buenzli 13 is going to be real  and is  currently in
preparation. After the big success of Buenzli 12 we just had to do another one. 
Be sure not to miss it - we're early enough with announcing the date so you can 
already  put  it into  your  schedule!  Buenzli 13,  20. - 22.  August 2004  in 
Winterthur,  Switzerland. This date has carefully  been selected to not collide 
with other  scene parties like Assembly or  Evoke and of  course, important for 
Swiss people, with the Streetparade.                      

The Buenzli  party is a  demoparty regularly  organized in  Switzerland.  After
having started  in the roots of the Swiss PC scene, it slowly left the woods to 
join some  hotel undergrounds.   When the party got bigger and more successful, 
it joined the bigger locations like  Bierhübeli in Berne to finally settle with 
style in the Kirchgemeindehaus in Winterthur.

The party features an awesome partyplace, this room is very famous for a lot of
conferences,  parties and  other events  it features  all throughout  the year.
You'll enjoy watching great demoshows on  the bigscreen (almost non stop) while
drinking a beer at the bar or the chill out corner.

Being first  the ultimate  Swiss scene event only,  every year Buenzli attracts 
more and more foreign sceners,  searching the real scene feeling and incredible 
party atmosphere  downtown Switzerland.  In other words, even with no computer, 
you'll have huge fun.        

Thanks to Conspiracy for the great invitation!  Thanks to Melwyn for handing it
in at Scene Event. Thank you for watching it and finally come to Buenzli.
