  The rush:
\/----------

    Okay, MAYBE once we can finish an intro IN TIME. Damn. :)

    BoyC had to leave this week and we're still busy working
    around and/or fixing the bugs we occasionally find.

    TrX is working overnight to finish the final touches,
    tomorrow we have to find Melwyn to get him the stuff
    somehow, and then sit back and be nervous about the
    thing not crashing and maybe looking like something we
    intended.

    Anyway, see ya all at Assembly'04.

  Random quotes:
\/---------------

    "Anyone seen TrX?"
      /Unlock/

    "I filled the bathtub with cold water, stuck my head in
    and kept yelling."
      /TrX/

    "Let's just add planets. We never did planets before anyway."
      /Gargaj/

    "I just don't get how TrX always manages to find the bugs
    in the system and how Zoom doesn't."
      /BoyC/
    
    "Well, I didn't notice any big flaws anymore... If there are
    any left, nobody will notice about them since nobody knows
    how it looked in aDDict."
      /Unlock/
    
    "It's not compiled in, how do you expect it to work?"
      /Gargaj/
    
    "Are you sure you don't want to put a church organ in?"
      /Unlock/
    
    "The stretch-filter doesn't allow non-uniform stretching tho."
    "...But here it does!"
    "It does?"
    "Yeah!"
    "...Next time i need to remember what I coded."
