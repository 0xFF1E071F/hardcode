This 64k is developed with a nvidia demobox (c2d2.2 -8800gts). Sorry i had
no time to optimize (i know its slow). For perfect running use nvidia based
7xxx+ cards. Ati totally not tested well (it runs on a borrowed laptop with 
mobile hd3450). Thanks to Remage/Fresh!mindworkz for helping with shadercoding
and Kb/Farbrausch for V2 softsynth and Pontscho/Rebels^Fresh!mindworkz for
additional system coding. You can expect a Mac version , with stored music 
(sorry there's no osx version of the synth).

We are back for real, here to have fun, and to release in the same spirit
as we always have done. Rebels is one of the true oldschool groups around. 
Founded in -88, we work to keep the friendship from the past alive in the 
scene today.
