Sileo:

This 64k intro is Immersions contribution to the 64kB intro competition at mainframe 2k2.
Sileo is latin for slacking, which is something that we enjoy very much. This intro
has only been tested using DirectX 8.1, but should run with anything newer than DirectX
6.1. This demo requires about 8MB of free system RAM, and a fast processor.
