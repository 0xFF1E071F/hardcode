[VERSION]

  TRINTRO.EXE          1.00.000

[INTRODUCTION]

This is a FAKE cracktro for "Tank Racer", the game we did the music for (we'd
be a bit stupid to crack it in that case!).  I just want to state for the
record that piracy is WRONG, EVIL and THE WORK OF SATAN.  I coded this simply
for a bit of a joke, I had the idea whilst going through my collection of
old Amiga intros.  Once again, I DID NOT CRACK TANK RACER!

For your information, the BBSs whose numbers are given in the intro are
LEGAL mono211-tonik distribution sites, DON'T try uploading warez to them!
The address is for aspiring musicians to send tapes to, and the "Elite"
greets list is simply all the groups from our links page, so don't read
anything into THAT either!

Am I getting overtly paranoid? ;)

[CONTENTS]

The archive should contain these files:

  TRINTRO.EXE
  README.TXT (this file)
  
[INSTALLATION]

Unpack the archive to anywhere you like and run TRINTRO.EXE whilst in
Windows 95/98/NT4.0+.  DOS is dead, accept it.

This intro requires that DirectX 6 is installed.  Well, I USED
version 6, but it's probably work with any version from 3.  NT 4.0 and
up includes DirectX 3, so all should be fine in the state of 211 there...

[INSTRUCTIONS]

What are you, stupid? ;)

[CREDITS]

  Code & GFX  by        "What year is it?" Subi (subi@mono211.com)
  Music                 "I wanna be WOTW" h0l (h0l@mono211.com)
  Logo by           	"Palletised graphics LIVE!" Dharma

Okay, I know, I'm a musician as well so why did I use an old tune of h0l's
in this intro?  He could always write better cheesy chip-tunes than I could,
THAT's why! ;)
