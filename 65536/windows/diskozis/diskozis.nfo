yes, another intro..

it's called diskozis and it's from nocturnal

it competed in the 64k intro compo at the gathering 2004

walker did the code
filijokkus did the music

the player is minifmod

neon, kusma and krav helped a little bit

lots of people should be greeted, but i'm too tired to remember who, so consider
yourself greeted anyway
