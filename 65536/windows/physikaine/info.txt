-- Tech info --

Code:
	The compiler used was Visual C++ 6.0.

	Executable file compressed with UPX v.1.01.

	BakTery lossed time in Intro engine, music synth and player,
        introduction space, isosurfaced cube with water and the 
	cutre-raytracing.

	Pocket unsleeped with Texture generator, physic hairball,
        physic pool, cutre-domino and the end flag.
			
Music:
	The samples were created using a simple own synth called BitGen
	and the song was played with our BitSound System. So, samples
	are generated procedurally when the intro starts.

	A realtime 'resonant-low pass' filter is applied to the mixing 
	on the space and the pool scenes.

	Floating point mixing. Linear interpolacion. No volume ramp ;(

	Module exported from FT2 XM file to BSG (BitSound Player Song 
	Format).

	Intro was syncroniced from the song using Ft2 Wxx column
        effect.

Fonts:
	Fonts were made by Awesome.

Design:
	Sorry here... we're looking for a good designer ;)

Trick:

	intro ;)
