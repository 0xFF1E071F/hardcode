System requirements
  
  Intel Pentium 3 or AMD Athlon/Duron 
  GeForce 256 or better graphics card
  recommended (TNT2 might work if you
  are very lucky). 128 MB ram and
  65536 bytes of free diskspace.

(Note: We were in an extreme hurry while finishing this sweety, so we couldn't find
any time to test it on some random machines. It seems to work pretty nice here, so
get yourself a decent PC if you are experiencing problems. For complaints e-mail: support@netscape.com)


general info: 

  This intro is a remix of the original Synergy released under Nosferatu label. Unfortunately
  the group died a week after the release at Mekka & Symposium 2001. We (Ravity and
  Crash) were asked to join Solar a few days later, and so we did. We weren't fully
  satisfied with the original Synergy, so we decided to spice it up a bit. 
  The result is here: Synergy Remix.


Troubleshooting:

Q) It generates a bluescreen on my PC, stating: "Aliens ate my neighbours".
A) Uninstalling the Seti@home software might solve the problem.

Q) Synergy doesn't run on my PC. What can I do?
A) Check if you have Linux installed. This program doesn't run on most Linux systems since it was
   designed to crash on Linux systems. Formatting your harddrive, and installing Windows might help.

Q) The intro causes my PC to hang. Is this normal?
A) Yes. It actually is a hidden feature.

Q) After I ran the intro my monitor turned black. Can I fix this?
A) Check if you have a videocard installed. It might help.

Q) Synergy runs rather slowly on my system. Is there any way to solve this?
A) This is VERY suspicious behavior. Contact the FBI as soon as possible.

Q) An error message pops up when I run the intro. What can I do?
A) Check if you have enough free diskspace.
