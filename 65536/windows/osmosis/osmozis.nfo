yes, another intro..

it's called osmozis and it's from nocturnal

it competed in the 64k intro compo at the gathering 2005

walker did the code
vildauget did the music

uses libv2 by kb/farbrausch

lots of people should be greeted, but i'm too tired to remember who, so consider
yourself greeted anyway
