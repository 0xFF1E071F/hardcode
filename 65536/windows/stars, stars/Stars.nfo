
   felt like doing something.

   mxmplay by elitegroup
   mpeg sample packing routines by sagacity, hellfire, cynic?
   mmx routines by hellfire
   intro system (ddraw+other ripped code stuff) by droid
   backup and additional stuff by tapeworm
   rest by melwyn

   runs ok with p2/k6-350+. tested only with win98 but should
   work fine with win2k, too - i suppose.
