from a summer full of silence, we are now back to enlighten you with

to get appreciated by some people.
the computer has to be equiped with mmx. it has been produced on a
p200mmx but for maximum pleasure, please choose a faster machine. no
extra hardware required except for a soundcard.

...some code was produced by whisker, and the notes triggered by flow/array...

a 65536b big intro, just to tell the world, that we do exist.
