hello there, you are now reading the infofile for...

Natural Selection by Disaster Area.

a non-accelerated production for the 64k intro competition at Mekka Symposium 2002.

(null)		code				(void303@hotmail.com - he never ever checks it tho ;)
ript.		code, music, graphics		(davet@tekniche.com.au)

the intro uses direct draw in 512x384x32bit mode. There's an option for windowed mode, but you must
have your desktop set to 32bit colour (it's a bit of a hack).

THERE ARE NO EXCUSES

It liked a 700mhz cpu last time I checked, but it probably likes more now. It hasn't been optimized
much at all. The poly drawer is slow as bog (can't be arsed fixing it right now).

THERE ARE NO EXCUSES

There's some weird sync bugs that turn up every 10th run or so. Dunno why.

THERE ARE NO EXCUSES

I'm pretty tired of the code now, and probably won't bother releasing a fixed (and optimized) version
unless people ask for it. Besides, I want to socialize rather than 'party code'.

THERE ARE NO EXCUSES

contact us if you feel like it ----> davet@tekniche.com.au (ript).

THERE ARE NO EXCUSES

this intro uses two very useful thingies: minifmod (www.fmod.org), and UPX (upx.tsx.org)
