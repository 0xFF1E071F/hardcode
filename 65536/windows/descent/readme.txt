
I sit with my nose to the screen tweaking splines, wrapped in a sleeping bag, forking pot noodle into myself,
a documentary about British computers playing in the background. Sceners are groggily wandering into the hall.
I say to myself: this is where I belong, and you are my people. 
Thanks to all my teachers.
