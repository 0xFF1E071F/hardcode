         - dEATH oF a sOCIETY -

well, nufan and me  decided to take part in
the  64k-competition 2 weeks ago.  we never 
did code together before, but it worked out
quite well. we  hope you enjoy  this little 
hack we have hopefully released at 

		THE PARTY 2k,
     held 27th till 29th of December 2ooo 
		Aars, Denmark

At least we enjoyed coding although this intro
is rather a quick hack. Some effects need a
very high fillrate (and I mean _very_), sorry
bout that, but we didn't wanna leave that
oversampling stuff out. Don't know if you can
expect a final version yet, this one here is
quite buggy and was finished (?) shortly before
deadline (as usual).

We had the opportunity to test it on GeForce,
GeForce2, TNT and TNT2 chipsets and things
worked fine in every case, although some parts
were slow on the older cards. As you know, 
Matrox and ATI seem to be not able to develop
good OpenGL drivers as well as 3dfx, so I
don't know if it works on those 3d-cards. As
long as you stay with NVidia chipsets and new
detonator drivers, there shouldn't be any
problems at all.

we would also like to thank:
 
  - elitegroup for the mxm-player
  - the guys who made the UPX exe-packer
  - probably shiva^kolor for the wavelet stuff
    (did we use it in the end???)
  - the rest of the scene. you may feel greeted
  - mindflower / freestyle for doing such a
    nice piece of music
  - tomic for doing some graphics shortly before
    deadline.
