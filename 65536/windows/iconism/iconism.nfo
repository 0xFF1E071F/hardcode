Released at Breakpoint '04 for the PC 64k compo.

OpenGL is required, the rest is up to you. I think at least one ghz of
processing power would make sense. Oh, and a working soundcard plus
a monitor might be interesting, too.


Well, this is my very first intro - and also my first try in graphics-coding.
I hope you can enjoy it anyway ;). Maybe others will follow...

I always thought that party-coding is some kind of bad habbit. Now I assume
that it might be a necessity... it's late now, and I'm quite happy that I could
finish my work in time :).

Greets and thanks go out to the following people:
alexa, ript., problematic, ace'r'us, conny, cosmo, sh0ck, pest, eric24, da fish


Disclaimer: this intro is freeware, I'm not responsible for anything that might
happen when you use it. However, nothing bad happened during all my tests.


Enjoy all the icons, cheers,
