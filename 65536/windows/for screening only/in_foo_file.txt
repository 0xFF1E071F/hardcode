 ok,  we are  lazy, but  not so  much. there is 
 some  work being carried out  in the dark, and
 since  we  always wanted  to contribute  to an
 hungarian  party ,  we  assembled  this  short
 trailer, keeping in mind that:

 - trailers are cool.
 - short releases are trendy.
 - we haven't  that  much  spare time anymore.
 - we haven't  any supernatural skill  anyway.
 - realtime  radiosity ain't any  imaginative.
 - long precalculation means big expectations.
 - 11.2s / 64000 bytes ,full  frame  rate , is
   a ridiculous compression ratio,but realtime
   is still cooler than divx.
 - breakpoint party will kick arses
 
 let's point out the credits:
 code   : rio
 gfx    : rio, dixan
 music  : dixan
 desing : not really needed (luckily)

 greetings:
 since the intro is too short to credit anyone,
 here you get a brief list, so that reading the
 infofile  will  take  you longer than watching
 the trailer.
 p.s.: of  course  greets have to be written in 
 the oldskool 3 char format:
  
  mfx.kwl.hjb.scx.ad.p.(b).unq.lnx.dcs.pht.fr.
  dkd.rno.grn.3st.abd.asd.flt.cdx.vnt.exd.skm.
 
 if you can't find yourself in the list,be more
 imaginative or get your group a 3 char name.
