
The Bustrip intro was planned to advertise the bustrip organized by Froggy.
Unfortunaly, the bustrip was canceled at the last moment. so we decided to
release the intro at The Party.

Run Bustrip.exe under win32, a sound driver must be installed.
If the intro doesn't run properly, intro.bat will print an error message.

I used two great lib : minifmod and tinyptc.
