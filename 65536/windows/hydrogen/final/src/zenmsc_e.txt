zenith matrix script calculator

Calculates a matrice by script. Script - opcodes woth parameters,
parameters devided by spaces, opcodes - by ";". Linefeeds - don't care.

Matrice calculation is a multiplication of rotation and so on matrices
in particular order (in scripted order)

opcodes:
rx <angle>; rotate around Ox by <angle> degrees
ry <angle>; -//- Oã
rz <angle>; -//- Oz
tr <x> <y> <z>; - translate by 3 axes
sc <x> <y> <z>; - scale by 3 axes
name <name>; - sets matrix name (for "copy packed")

type in the script and "Calc" + "Copy Packed"

Matrice now goes to the clipboard. Then in vcpp - paste:


char  <name>[10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}; //<----this is a packed matrice
      ^your name here (for example packed_m)

MATRIX m;
m.Unpack(&packed_m);
Finished. Matrice is ready to use
