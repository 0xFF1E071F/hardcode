 [OS::          win9x/ME/2k/XP,DX7+
 [System::
  (approx.)     min:  500MHz / 64M / PCI video
                 (ran even on 166Mhz).
                pref: 800Mhz-1GHz / 128M / AGP video
                cool: 27GHz P8 / 4096M / Geforce5 ;)

                MMX IS required

 [Video::       TrueColor video mode
                NO hardware 3d accelerator required!
                640x480, 512x384, 320x240
                (each full screen or windowed,
                 but full screen is much faster)
                both 32 and 24bpp (truecolor) modes supported

 [Sound::       44100, 22050, nosound
                (almost no difference in speed, but
                22050 sounds shity ;)

[Troublems?::
 [Too slow::    - try upgrading ;)
                - try smaller resolutions
                - run in full screen mode
                - and finally close winamp and quake running in
                  background ;)

 [512x384::     this may not work full screen. Just uncheck "Resize
                to fullscreen". It will run fullscreen on 640x480
                with black frame around

 [Windowed::    this will automatically set your desktop to
                truecolor mode and restore it back

 [Win2k::       in fullscreen modes with "Resize to fullscreen" checked
                it can silently fall if mode is not supported under win2k.
                Uncheck "Resize to fullscreen"

[Dizcription::
 [Wassup::
  This is KCN's first ever intro. We tried to do our best
  making it.

 [The story so far::
  ...and elmm told me (zZz) he wants to create it, i mean a 64k intro.
  "well, great! ;)" i said. and he started doing some things for
  vesa under dos4gw. some weeks later someone told him to make it
  for win32. and he ported the whole stuff to win32. and then
  he also ported one of my laboratory works on computer graphics (one
  with a render). the render was called z3d. actually it was
  a 1/4 of a render, coz it could only render one object and
  shade it by phong (although in real time). at this moment
  elmm told me he didn't want a 64k anymore but a megademo instead.
  i started writing those missing parts of z3d and finally
  had almost rewritten the render. and when i had almost finished
  elmm told we were again writing a 64k ;).
  after some time elmm and ygrek came to my house. we put three
  computers in a net and barricaded in my room for three days to
  finish the stuff. and ygrek wrote a module that made the stuff
  62k. but after some time i've cut some corners and made it 53k ;)
  though we didn't finish it then. some weeks later i managed
  to create one more scene, and then together with elmm another one.
  some more weeks passed. LSD asked us for sources and started
  creating one more scene. that time i also made a finish greetingz
  scene. finally it was finished. pheeew! such a small intro
  took us almost a year!
