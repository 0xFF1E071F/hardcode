   Geforce 2 MX or better
   800x600x32

Run "sub64td.exe w"

First time at any demoscene 
party!
This is actually 52K intro,
I ran out of time and 64K
is just so much space!

Credits:
  Tomkh - everything
 
  No 3rd party modelers,
  trackers, libraries
  My own custom tracker,
  realtime synth and modeler
  All objects made with
  iterative rules
  Realtime growing from 
  single cell (last scene)
  Procedural music
  (patterns can be called
   like procedures with
   a little more parameters 
   than just pitch/volum ;))
  

External tools:
  My own tracker for music
  My own tool for modeling 
  procedural creatures
  My own texture editor
  (all tools will be 
   released someday)
  Upack by Dwing
  (exe compression)
  Evaldraw by Ken Silverman
  (prototyping equations)
............................
Hidden keys:
P = pause
F = fast forward (may crash!)
SPACE = show bonus model
(works during ending scroll)

Greets for all!
