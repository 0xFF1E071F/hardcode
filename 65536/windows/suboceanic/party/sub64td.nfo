............................
First time at any demoscene 
party!
This is actually 50K intro,
I ran out of time and 64K
is just so much space!
............................
System requirements:
   Pentium 3 800MHz
   OpengGL 1.5+
   Geforce 2 MX or better
   800x600x32

Run "sub64td.exe w" 
for windowed mode.
Create "texcache" dir
to speed up precalculation
next time.

Credits:
  Tomkh - everything
 
  No 3rd party modelers,
  trackers, libraries
  My own custom tracker,
  realtime synth and modeler
  All objects made with
  iterative rules
  Realtime growing from 
  single cell (last scene)
  Procedural music
  (patterns can be called
   like procedures with
   a little more parameters 
   than just pitch/volum ;))
  

External tools:
  Upack by Dwing
  (exe compression)
  Evaldraw by Ken Silverman
  (prototyping equations)

Greets for all!
