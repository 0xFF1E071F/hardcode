  This party version is quite performance intensive because I don't
  do any early visibility culling at all :) The whole scene is thrown
  at the graphics card every frame, but what the heck, everyone's got
  a geforce today anyway :) or perhaps not. I'll optimize the final 
  version better.
  My computer is a PII400 witha GF2MX and it runs it pretty well, though
  it's not perfectly smooth.
