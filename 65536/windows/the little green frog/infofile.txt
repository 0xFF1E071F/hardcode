it's "the little green frog" by disasterarea in the year 2003ad.

made for the mfx/kewlers birthday party.

apparently making this was more fun than giving away a six-pack!

thank goodness for that.

hip hip! hooray!

some credits:
------------
code/etc: ript.
ideas: anji

some requirements:
-----------------

to run this you need windows + opengl + soundcard.
hopefully you can manage that.

some useless info:
-----------------
no we're not trying to be fuzzion. they would've done it in 4k,

i would just like to say that no modelling/animation programs
were used in the creation of this intro.
