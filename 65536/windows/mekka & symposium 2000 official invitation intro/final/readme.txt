Thanks to snq/aardbei for giving me his fontcode and aided me in debugging
(not by reading his code, but instead by rereading the source very carefully
step-by-step and looking out for other possible reasons ;))

This program reportedly runs on over 15 pcs with entirely different
graphics cards, DirectX versions, Windows versions, and amount of RAM,
so if it doesn't run or crashes on your machine, it may be a driver bug
and not our fault. Please take that into account if you think you en-
countered a bug. Thanks ;)

Known Bugs (will be fixed later, hopefully):
- no known bugs anymore, if you should find something, feel free to
  contact us (and it would be nice if you could include a description
  of your computer, including Windows version, gfx/sound card
  and RAM, for it helps us figuring bugs out)

Contact:
- for bug reports, questions, submission of if you found the
  hidden part, e-mail to: kb@ms.demo.org

----------------------------  THE STUFF ------------------------------

What you're looking at (when running the intro, that is) is the result
of about two weeks of more or less hard work. No, there isn't much design
or the likes in it, doing that kinda stuff is in fact up to YOU for the
MS2000 demo/intro compos :)

Additional credits have to go to Chaos/FEB/Ex-Sanity for providing the
original Amiga fonts, to the UAE makers for giving us a possibility
to look up the original, to Niklas Beisert for MXMPlay (which our player
is based on), to Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar for UPX and
various people from the Scala Family and IRCNet's #kotraum for testing
and helping out with ideas.

The intro contains about 512k of graphics, 3MB of pre-synthesized music
(with additional realtime effects) and 30K of text. The code consists
of about 12000 lines hand-crafted ASM plus about 1300 lines C, as we were
too lazy :). All this stuffed in a neat 46K EXE file. So much for "Windows
programs have to be big and bloated".

And ofcourse we coded hundreds, nah, thousands, na, HALF A DOZEN of useful
tools that were used more or less intensive in the creation of this intro ;)

Anyway, we hope that you all will come to us and have a great time visiting
the Mekka & Symposium 2000. We're looking forward to you.
