PX:AG - Bustro

This is our first production. We hope you liked it.

Our 64k intro called "Bustro" has been build in about 8 days of
extreme - 24/7 - coding right before the Assembly 2005. We took
a 2 week vacation for our roadtrip to Helsinki. In the beginning
our aim was to present this roadtrip in our intro. Due to the fact
that we never would have gotten enough content finished 'til the
deadline, we decided to change our plans. So we reduced the hole
intro to Jan's bus and accompanied the retro-look with flowers.

After finishing the needed content we still suffered from the lack
of a tune. So we had to hack a little tune together in a hurry.
Next time a real musician will do that part hopefully. ;-)

Our thanks go out to the Assembly jury who accepted our intro
although we totally missed the deadline. We also like to thank
Contraz, Excess and Portal Process for their moral support.
Thank you guys. ;-)
