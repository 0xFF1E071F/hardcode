Pure partycoding with a stub of a softsynth and dnload by faemiyah (which broke on me...)
This piece of art represents my feelings of stress and relative incompetence.
Technically a 64k, though most of that is glew and dynamic linking code.
some more greets: branch, shiona, msqrt, cce, ninnnu, Aleksi (from hellu), Aaro, instanssi organizers (sorry if I didn't remember you and I should have)
Apart from hectic partycoding, Instanssi has been amazing.
