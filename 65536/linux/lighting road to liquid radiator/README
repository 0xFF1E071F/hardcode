~~~ Lighting Road To Liquid Radiator ~~~

A Linux 64k released by skypers from
The Undead Sceners on Outline 2013.

----------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN IT
----------------------------------------

The intro was compiled on a 64 bits archlinux.
You’ll need at least OpenGL 3.3 with GL_ARB_tessellation_shader
extension.

To run it, just call it that way:

  ./lr2lr 1920 1080 # if your resolution is 1920x1080

or better

  ./lr2lr 1920 1080 f # f to enable fullscreen

Thank you :)
