 The windows and linux version are included in the archive.
 macOSX version will follow and will be downloadable from 

 http://www.m4nkind.com. 

 Some other version would follow on strange hardware like 
 amigaone/aos4 or pegasos/morphos as soon as the drivers 
 are aviable, or avaïabeul, or available.

 The polygonised character is "jose bove", a french poor 
 "bio" farmers fighting against the big industry. hopefully 
 for the moment he is not in jail, only in a 64kb intro. 

 Thanks for your attention.
