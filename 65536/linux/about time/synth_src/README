Here's the synth source.

When I was saying how a windows port is soon, I forgot to realise that I don't have a windows box.  I'm
currently installing vmware for that (although someone suggested I use wine, which is a good idea).  I
also know fuck-all about windows..  it's Audio.h/cpp that need rewriting for windows support.

I'm now rewriting the synth to use the FFT algorithm rather than band-limited wavetables, which means I
could generate pretty much any wave shape and play it back at any frequency.  Dunno when I'll finish 
that one.

"test_mprx.h" is the data from the recorded song I did with linux renoise.  Note the record button.  I
should write a tutorial on how to use this, but I can't be arsed :-D

Feel free to make the drums louder.  Or write a proper feedback-based drum synth (have a look at 
render_function in Generator.cpp for this).

If you do add anything, please email me your shit!  This is now licensed under GPL3.

enjoy.
