Requirements:

  Linux, OpenGL support, preferably fast, even more preferably much more
  faster. Tested on NVidia, but no exotic extensions are used.
  
Usage:

  *NOTE*. If you don't have low-res modes (640x480) configured in your 
  X server, the intro will default to current X mode. Running this production 
  on a 1600x1200 _will_ kill the performance.

  Set the env variable NOSOUND=1 for forced nosound, WINDOW=1 for 
  windowed mode.
