Description

 This is my first demo, and I never expected
 it to be less than 64KB. :-/
  
 Made in about 10 days by someone who...
 - has never made a demo before
 - had very little experience with SDL and
   opengl
 - is definitely not a graphic artist
 - had NO experience with creating computer
   generated music
 - is definitely not a musician
 - just loves to play with code and to learn
   new things :)


Requirements

 A computer with a graphics card, d'uh!

 Probably works (but not tested) on a 300Mhz
 PII with an old graphics card. 1.0Ghz+ with
 modern graphics card recommended.

 Made on linux, but runs on every PC with a C
 compiler and SDL libraries. Windows port and
 sources included. Ports to other systems and
 other downloads can be found on
 http://dev.yorhel.nl/BlueCubes/


Command-line options

 There are 3 options to set the screen
 resolution:
 -r 1   Lowest resolution   (800x600)
 -r 2   Higher resolution  (1024x786)
 -r 3   Highest resolution (1280x960)
 By default, the demo will try to use the
 highest resolution possible.

 The demo will be fullscreen by default, use
 -w to view the demo in a window.
