                         Neutral, a 64kb intro by Coral

   A third part of intro trilogy ( :) ) by Coral. Maybe a demo next time.
               Placed 5th at Assembly '96 64k introcompetition.

    code: Weed                     SB  version  is  over 64kb  because  rules
   music: Weed                     allow  so. Compo  (gus)  version is  64kb.
    font: Hitchy Hit               SB support sucks,  because I haven't got a
    pics: me'q                     XM  player for  SB .. so  it's a  MOD when
                                   using  SB :). Might  also work under win95
 Made  from  COMPLETE  scratch in  but  the  timing  isn't  'quite'  correct.
 one week. Uses Eclipse Operating  SB doesn't  work under  win95. Requires at
 System (EOS) 2.07 by Eclipse and  least 2 mb of memory and a 386sx to start,
 Cubic MXM  Player by Cubic Team.  but you  should have at  least a 486dx2/66
 Thanks  to  me'q  for  pictures.  for optimal viewing pleasure.
