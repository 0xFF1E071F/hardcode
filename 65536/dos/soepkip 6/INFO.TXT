                         SOEPKIP 6 : RANDOM BAGGER
             (he! we hebben nog ruimte voor een extra sample!)

  Disclaimer: This demonstration requires a VGA-COMPATIBLE CARD!! We are very
    sorry for those who still own EGA boards, but it seems like more and more
     people are using the new VGA standard, and we have to go along with this
                            trend. Please don't call us lame because of this.

                                                                   the heroes:

                                          sneaqo/aardbei        : programming
                                          inopia/quad           : programming
                                          deadline/superstition :       music

Everything runs smooth on a 286 with a vga compatible card and adlib installed.
 (in fact, that's a lie, but who is going to try anyway?). However, we suggest
                  something like a p133+ with a GUS and 64k of free disk space.
                                                   A funny hat is not required.

                  for the sb version, any soundcard supported by midas will do.
