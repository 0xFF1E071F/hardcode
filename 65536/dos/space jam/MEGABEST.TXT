		      ³ 			     
		      ³   this fantastic intro was made by fascination for
		      ³   the assembly '94 intro compo. it requires a 386
		      ³   processor with vga display. ultrasound is required 
		      ³   to hear the music. we didn't include support for sb 
		      ³   and compatibles, because there are still people 
		      ³   who don't own a gus yet. 
		      ³ 
                      ³   everything runs like a dream on a 486/33 vlb,
                      ³   and most parts (everything but the bounching
                      ³   vector & glentz) should run smoothly on a slow 386.
                      ³   gusplay causes some delays to vectors. that's
                      ³   because we didn't make a vertical retrace interrupt
                      ³   routine. sorry. there are also some other bugs.
                      ³   we won't fix them. sorry. design also sucks.
                      ³   we don't care. sorry.

		      ³   if space jam doesn't work with your computer, buy 
                      ³   one like ours. yeah, it's not our fault if you
                      ³   own a bad computer.
                      ³
                      ³   if you think you can code faster and/or nicer
                      ³   routines, compose cooler musics or draw better
                      ³   gfx than we did, why don't you join us? We offer
                      ³   you nice benefits (company car, own private
		      ³   secretary, etc.), among with competitive salary. 
		      ³   we are desperately looking for more coders and 
		      ³   musicians (maybe gfx artists too), so we'll accept 
		      ³   almost anyone. don't wait to tomorrow, it may 
		      ³   maybe be too late.

		      ³   now that you have seen space jam (if you haven't,
