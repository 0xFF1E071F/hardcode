wext 1.10b extender by whizzter of whoo
usmp 1.1 player by freddyv/useless (unfortunately it fucks the music
a little bit :(, so you'd better hear this module in normal player, it was
realesed as a chip on horizon 2k party)
plusz active&coca-cola for keeping me awake...

and people who helped me with this: impexus (that one advice saved me),
angelo (yes, pal), mancer (thx for our codin' chats :)

fucks go to tlink and/or nasm creators for changing my life into nightmare...


recipe, or in other words requirements:
(huh, i'm not quite sure what are they, because it wasn't really tested ;),
but i'll guess :-)

take a quite good comp (i think p200 will be ok), because on slower ones some
effects will not be shown correctly
add a pinch of ram (8 mb or so :)
mix with your good mood and cook slowly, stir often
enjoy! :)
i hope you won't throw up -_^


SOME COMMENTS:
Done in so much time I don't even want to think about that...
If you think that this intro is a little bit unfinished - you're wrong!
It's totally unfinished...
Above all, engine reeeealy sucks, but I didn't really have time to fixup
everything.
I know this is preety shitty, but next ones will be better :) I hope :)
