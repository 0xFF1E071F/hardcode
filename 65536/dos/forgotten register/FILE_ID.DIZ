Fo4g0tT3N R3g1sT3R 64kb intro for Grv'98 (c) 1998 Banshik/Apatia^ByteWay!

It was written on p2 233MHz, 32mb, S3 Virge 2mb, GUS and later tested
on 486dx4-100MHz, 16mb, Trident 1mb, SB16 [no sound] and it was horrible
experience ;) Better don't try to run it on machines under p133.

Fell free to put it onto any CD/ftp or something like this,
but if You can - send to me (banshik@irc.pl) information about it.
