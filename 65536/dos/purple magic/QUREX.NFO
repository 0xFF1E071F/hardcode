The group Phenomena PC is now officially dead!
----------------------------------------------
The rising of this group was a idea from an old fox, the former Phenomena
member, The Big A. Together with Scout, Pletrex, Rolemaster, Gurgle and
Necromancer, he restarted Phenomena again. Though the A has now disappeared from
the scene, and therefore we decided to end this chapter and move on to a new
era. We decided to start a new group so that we would not damage the legendary
name of Phenomena. To show the world that we were alive and kicking I
(Rolemaster) and Pletrex decided to release a little 64k intro at The Party V.
Though we hadnït planned anything before the party we managed (with hard work
and some help from good friends) to finish it before the deadline. We did this
in 12 hours!



Hopefully you have liked Purple Magic, and hopefully you will hear from us again
sometime. We are aiming for Icing -96.
