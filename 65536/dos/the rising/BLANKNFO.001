         Warning! This .nfo is as finished and final as the intro, yet!

                               њ Introduction?! њ

 So most of you have never heard about Blank, neither saw a production from us,
  not surprising, this is the first release which ever made it through to the
    public... This little textfile tries to satisfy all your curiosities and
                       even more. Well... Most of them.

                                  њ Credits! њ

    All that cool Introcode was done by Q - except Robban`s GusPlay, but who
  really needs his (her?) own replayer? The from 64k to 27k cutted Soundtrack
  was composed by Front 6. The font and, especially, the fab picture was done
  by Digital, same with the Blank Logo which`s looking so incredible in the
               intro... all other objects were done by Q.
               Enough Boredom? Ok, I`ll tell you a story...

                        њ How do I reach those fools? њ

   The best way is by calling Magican II: Wicked Scene at +49-421-689431

   And leave your message to the member you`d like to contact, but since
  Q has no modem, the best way to contact him is by leaving a comment to fiSh.

                            њ Small information њ

     Simply wait for the final release which will feature better sound,
     Sound Blaster support and maybe some more improvements to get more
                    information about us and our doings.
