This intro was coded according to the old rules which stated that GUS OR SB
should be supported. When we noticed that the rules were changed we didn't
have time to add SB support, so this intro is GUS only. So if the intro
isn't shown it may NOT be released. (and of course if the intro is shown
and released this file should be deleted :)
