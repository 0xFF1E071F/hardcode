                          AN INTRODUCTION BY VELOCITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 First presented at ASM'95 64kb introcompo. This intro contains a new effect
 called "Dong"-shading and also some motion blur and something crap (find it
 out yourself!). For music we recomment Gravis Ultrasound. This intro runs
 smoothly on 486DX2/66 with Tseng Labs-display card or better. And here's some
 personal greetings:
