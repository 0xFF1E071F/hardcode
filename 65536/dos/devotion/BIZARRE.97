To all Bizarre organisers

Hi!...

Well for old times being
        Congratulate on your party.
I hope it will be very c00l
        and as always very enterprizing (for me at least)

uhhh...

Please don't run the DEVOHIGH.exe during the compo, but the DEVOTION.exe.
cause I haven't seen any computer where it ran oke.
And please use the General MIDI of the SBAWE32. for better sound.

Hope to see you all soon and bye for now.

Grtx & good luck...

FyR/iMAGE!...
