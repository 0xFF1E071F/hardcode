Needed to run
	Pentium or higher PC
	12 Mb free intern memory
	And a VGA Card 

For optimal results	
	Pentium or higher PC
	12 Mb free internal memory
	And a very fast VGA card with software or hardware VBE2.0
	in 320*200*24bits or 320*200*32bits
        MPU401 or compatible soundcard (Wavetables/synthesizer)

Used during development
	686 150+ 32Mb memory
	K6 200 16 Mb memory
	Korg X5 Synthesizer
	
Two versions
	There are two versions of Devotion
	the first version is for highend PC and the other is for the very- 
	super-deluxe-high-end-supercomputers. The only difference between 
	these two versions is the vector engine.
 
Resolution supported
	320*200*32bits	(vbe20 needed for this resolution)
	320*200*24bits	(vbe20 needed for this resolution)
	640*400*8bits	(failsafe mode I, vbe20 needed for this resolution)
	320*200*8bits	(failsafe mode II, VGA card needed for this mode)
	
	The failsafemodes are fake truecolor modes using a X and a Y divisor 
        of two. And you won't miss much, cause of the FakeColorEmulator
	
Intel & AMDK6-Bug
        There is an known K6 bug alse for some intels. It seemes like the K6
        is optimised for multiplation and divisors. And not for the simple
        look and move work. 
	The first two parts will be extremely slow and you will miss the
	effect produced by me. This bug doesn't occur always. The vector
        engine doesnot have this bug.
        I've mannaged to remove this bug but not for all computers for some
        strange reason it still is very slow on some computers.
