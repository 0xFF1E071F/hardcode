                          ------------------------



        You may not know what is Halcyon and what it does. Don't worry
        (be happy), this info-file is created for all the stupid persons
        like you, which don't know what Halcyon is. Please notice before
        you stop reading this that THIS INFOFILE IS _NOT_ AS STUPID
        AS SOME OTHER INFOFILES THAT USES ABOUT 50 KILOS HARDDISK!!


        Oh well, I'd better start with history.. Halcyon was founded
        by Blitz and fate in 1993 (or 1992, who cares!?!?). In the
        beginning it was _VERY_ (I really mean _VERY_) lame group
        and the name was different (I wont mention the name here..).
        We released couple of products, mainly utilities, but then
        we made our first BIG mistake: we decided to make an intro
        (without any graphicians or musicians!). So, we had two
        members, both coders and we made an intro. You can imagine
        the quality of that intro.. Later in 1993 we made another
        intro, that was bullshit too. In the end of 1993 Copter
        (graphician) and Mr.BUG (musician) joined us. We changed our
        group's name. After couple of months we kicked Mr.BUG out,
        'coz he didn't do anything. PLacidity joined us as designer
        and graphician. We released an X-MAS-intro (which was bullshit
        too) and Croaker (musician) & Bass-Cadet (musician) joined
        us. It was year 1994 and we changed our group's name to Halcyon.
        Vorpal (ANSI artist) & Cabby (coder) joined us and we kicked
        Copter out, 'coz we don't like superELITES and he couldn't
        draw anything acceptable (Actually Copter left our group
        himself, but we were planning to kick him out anyway, 'coz
        he couldn't draw very well). After couple of months we realized
        that Cabby can't code and we kicked him out. Sigh joined us
        as musician and we kicked Vorpal and Bass-Cadet out too, 'coz
        Bass-Cadet didn't do anything and we realized that we don't
        need ANSI-artist. Couple months before Assembly'94 we started
        making an intro for Assembly'94 introcompetition. That intro
        weren't shown on big screen (we knew it) and couple weeks after
        Assembly'94 we realized that our ASM-intro was coded very badly
        and it has too old effects in it. At first we though that we
        could release a 'bugfixed' version, which is totally rewritten
        =), but who the fuck cares, it's oooold intro and now we could
        do _MUCH_ better.. Well, a month has been after ASM'94 and fate
        did leave our group, but it doesn't mean anything to us. Well,
        since we had made some effects, we decided to put 'em together
        and so we made an little intro called DREAM. Many people asked
        us to do nosound version of DREAM, so we did it (FUCK!!)..


        As you can see our member-status is changing all the time.
        Currently we have four members:

          Croaker    (Jaakko Iisalo)   Musician    [78]  [486dx/50/8]
          Blitz      (Kimmo Kangas)    Coder       [79]  [486dx2/66/4]
          PLacidity  (Petri Lievonen)  Graphician  [79]  [1200/2c+4f]
          Sigh       (Sakari Hyrkk”)   Musician    [79]  [386dx/25/4]
          Ember      (Jarkko Lipponen) GFX, 3Dobjs [77]  [500/1c]

        As you can see, we all are quite young, but I think we
        are pretty good. In the beginning, when we were lame group,
        we made mainly utilities (DOS & SBBS, which usually were
        bullshit), but now we are making mainly demos & intros.
        Ofcoz we make everything what comes to our mind.

        I won't tell you our group's older names, 'coz they
        were _LAME_ and they released _SHIT_! So, our current
        group, Halcyon, has offically born in the beginning of
        the year 1994 and it has nothing to do with older shits.
