.THE PARTY 1995 WAS CORRUPTED!!! THE ORGANIZERS FAKED ALL THE COMPOS!!!
 grab the neat 4channel module by Velvet, called 'Stream Of Energy' to
 find out! it didn't even make it to the compo!! when hearing most of
 the rest of the 4channel ones, you'll also reagard this as RIDICULOUS!!

 not to mention that LOLA was not shown, too!! vote for yourself - we
 do not regard it as that worthless...

 everything that went wrong at sucking Party5 will be fine at MeKKA'96!!

.call  farmers inn  for pure fun, indeed!
