        HUGE CROWD                         a NOOON/ORANGE Production

        december 24th 1996

        .barti zeb and dune visited the big-bang university.



        two days of intro making.

        it requires near 600k of base memory and near 2M of XMS.

        no need of EMM managers like QEMM or EMM386.


        trying to make another intro.

        just some 'crowded' zbuffered vectors.
