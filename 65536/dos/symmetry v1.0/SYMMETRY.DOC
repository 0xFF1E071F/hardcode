                          Guru Magic's First 64Kb Intro
          This demo took first place at the Explosive Demo Competition





This demo was written exactly two days prior to Explosive.  With
Symmetry, Inside 2 by Deacon and Fly by Baroque (13 and 4 channel
MOD/P16 respectively), Guru Magic took first place in all categories
entered.

The party was a great success, had a great atmosphere and basically
a good turn out of the local crews.



More about the demo
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Symmetry requires a 386 or better machine, a VGA card and monitor
as well as about 100Kb (probably less  :-) of EMS.  It DOES NOT
require SmartDRV!  :-)  Oh, yeah, it MUST have a SoundBlaster or
compatable sound board.

This demo is rather small, but we -know- you will enjoy it.  :-)

The commandline options, which will allow you to switch down the
mixing speed and of course manually configure the SoundBlaster can
be viewed by typing:

  SYMMETRY /?

You'll get further help from there.

That's about all from us - if you wish to see the official results
for all the competitions, see the accompanying file EXPLOSIV.DOC

Thanks for taking the time to read this document,

Abacus and DAC/Guru Magic
