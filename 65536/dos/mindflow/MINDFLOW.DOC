 [data file]
 .the data file is not necessairy, meaning this intro fully respects
  the rules of the 64kb competition of bizarre'97 (no writing to disk)
 .on a p166, the precalcing of the datafile + the running time of
  the show is less than 8 minutes, again meaning the intro fully
  respects the rules of bizarre'97.
 .without the data-file, mindflow will start with rendering.
  this can take a few minutes. the raytracer is size optimised,
  not speed, it's quite slow.
 .the size of the data file is this big because all data is in 24bpp
  format, meaning one pixel takes 3 bytes. for example the first 16 frames
  of animation mindflow starts with is 320x200x3x16 = 3072000 bytes
 .the size of the data file should be 7372288 bytes.
 .cdrom creators, please include the datafile on the cdrom

 [video]
 .resolution is 320x200
 .all screens are calculated in 24bpp, 24bpp is the best videomode
  for this intro
 .when 24bpp is not supported, mindflow looks for 32bpp,
  15bpp and finally 8bpp.
   .32bpp still gives every color detail, no remapping
   .15bpp requires remapping (slows down the framerate) but still gives
    a fairly good result
   .8bpp also requires remapping and the color output is very low!
 .if you only get 8bpp, please load univbe (try the latest version)
 .in 32bpp and 24bpp modes, anti-aliassing is optional
 .24bpp, 32bpp and 15bpp modes require LFB (linear frame buffer)

 [parameters]
 /0       start mindflow without music
 /1       start mindflow with GUS music (default port 0x220)
 /8       force 8bpp output (should always work)
 /aa      anti-alias 24bpp or 32bpp output
 /210
 ..
 /260     change default gus port

 [note]
 .when this intro was almost finished, we remembered an excellent demo
  on the Amiga also called Mindflow. we did not intentionally steal the
  mindflow name, hope everybody is okay with this.

 [bizarre, lowres, takeover?]
 at first this intro was supposed to be released at the bizarre'97
 party. the intro was delivered to the organisers well before the
 deadline. unfortunately the bizarre organisers had some trouble
 with the video-projector and in the chaos they forgot to play mindflow
 in the 64kb compo. it got worse when people weren't able to vote for
 the 64kb compo on the voting network. because the biz'97 organisers
 themselves thought mindflow should have won the compo, they, on their
 own initiative, took the intro from the network and so mindflow wasn't
 released at all. thank god for honoust party organisers.
 lowres'97 was the first demoparty held after biz'97 in the netherlands,
 but after seeing the party (sorry guys, you know it wasn't any good) and
 hearing there even weren't any prizes, again Mindflow didn't get to be
 released. after hanging around a while, we decided to change the mindflow
 music and update the effects a bit.
 next try, takeover'98. since Mindflow already is a pretty famous intro
 in the dutch demoscene, we hope people won't have their judgment ready
 again (like simstim).

 [stash and mindflow]
 the excellent intro "stash" by the black lotus might be compared to this
 intro when it comes to prerendering time. just to avoid unnecessairy
 discussions, mindflow was made months before stash and the method of
 prerendering mindflow uses is very different from stash. jace/tbl saw
 mindflow at bizarre'97 and got a mindflow version at lowres'97. we talked
 about stuffing megabytes of graphics into a 64kb intro (actually, jace
 wanted to put the mindflow raytracer in stash at first but nix didn't
 like the idea) and we found out we both use very different methods. both
 of us on our own initiative without influence of eachother decided
 to use this huge prerendering time so please don't start a "where is
 this world going to" discussion or worse, a stupid "mindflow stole the
 idea from stash" or "stash stole the idea from mindflow" discussion. yeah.

 [symbolic for the art people]
 weird, art can seem to be much better when you understand what the artist
 means. like orange refering to salvador dali and stuff.
 indeed, the mindflow 64kb intro also has a subject. try to figure it out.
 a fungus spreading spores.. those swimming ahum.. balls at the end and
 the big blue egg.. much symbolic stuff.. got it yet?
