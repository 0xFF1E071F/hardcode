                              SEXY by Alpha Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 requires 286/VGA to be executed and at least 486/VGA to run perfectly.

 This intro was made for the Plutonium 2000 party. It was mostly coded on a
 486dx/80 and runs in full framerate on that machine (should also on a 66mhz).
 The Midas soundsystem doesn't seem to like Winblows when using SB for sound,
 so please run it under DOS (not in a DOS-box). GUS seems to work fine under
 Winblows...
