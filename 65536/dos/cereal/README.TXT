ceREAL was made by s.m.b.d.y. during The Gathering 1999 held at Hamar.
This was our contribution to the 64k intro compo. The intro is written
as an MS-DOS application, but it will probably also work under Windows.
It requires about 5 mb free memory. I'll probably upload the source code 
at http://home.telia.no/fartein some day. If you want to contact us, send an
