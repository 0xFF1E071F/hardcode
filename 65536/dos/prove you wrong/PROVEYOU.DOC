 Bandwagon presentation 1996

 Required:
 =========
  - 386SX-processor
  - VGA adapter
  - 390k base memory (about 20k less with GUS)

 Recommended:
 ============
  - 486SX-processor
  - SB or GUS

 Command line parameters:
 ========================
   /n            Run with no sound
   /r:?????      Use SB rate of ?????
   /g            Don't autodetect GUS. This for people who have GUS and SB
                 and for some reason really want to use SB.

 About this intro
 ================
        I can't really think of anything to fill this space with. Only a few
  words about the SB support. If the demo is damn slow lower the samplerate.
  If the sound starts to crack and whiz lower the samplerate. If the demo
  still sluggs and the sound quality sucks lower it more. At least the
  GUS-player should work fine with almost any machine. This intro was however
  not designed for the slowest machines. It does work with a 386SX/20 (I partly
  wrote the effects with one) but the intro isn't fully enjoyable then.
  Most of the effects will appear slower and some of them incorrect.
  I guess most of you would've figured out that yourself too.
  But that's really all I can think of. If you have some questions, comments
  or anything don't hesitate to contact us.

          Bye..
