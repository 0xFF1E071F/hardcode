BCN Party '00 winner 64k intro

DOS, Pentium+, VESA2, GUS, SB, etc

a poem

the sb+gus version runs fine under win
the gus only version slows down under win
due to a problem with the mxm player BUT...
the gus only version sounds fine. the gus+sb
player (USM) fucks up the floating tempo.

the rhyme is null, but is the fuckin' reality

so if you have a gus, lucky you.
watch it under plain dos and enjoy.

thanks to Maverick / 100percent
for the ascii :)

cheers
