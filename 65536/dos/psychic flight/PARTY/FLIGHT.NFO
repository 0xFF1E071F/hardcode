 AAAAAARGH !!! after a long time of coding, the intro
 was finally finished on the party place, just one day before
 the intro compo started (great timing huh?).
 The running time of PSYCHIC FLIGHT is about 5:45 and
 the size of is 64669 bytes.
 You need at least a 386 with GUS (the intro will work
 without GUS, but it's your own risk), but we recommend
 a 486DX2/66 with a fast VGA card. You also need about 
 500Kb of free conventional memory.
 A monitor is optional.
 
 Without the help of some people this intro wouldn't
 be finished in time.
 So BEYOND REALITY CREW, thanks very very VERY (!!) much
 for letting us use your 486DX2 on the boat from Stockholm to Helsinki
 and at the party:
 LISEN (female coder), MARX, ADDeR, P$y›h0!, Tiphareth, UNIBITS, LENIN :
 YOU'RE GREAT FRIENDS !!!!

 Also special thanks to DEAD BIRD for lending his 
 computer and thanks to BLOODY for helping us at the party.

 This file wouldn't be complete without the names of the
 people who travelled all the way from the NETHERLANDS to
 HELSINKI, FINLAND with us. So here they come :

 - Arjen Groot Roessink             -  Bertram Scheltema
 - Roland van Oorschot              -  Herman Dullink
 - Michel Selten                    -  Alexander Klomp
