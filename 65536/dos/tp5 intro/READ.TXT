
   TP5 Intro! ;)


   Intro finished in a hurry just before deadline on December 28th 1995
   for TheParty 5 intro-compo.
   Everything but shadows was done at the party place!

   No time to do any furher (required) work. :(

   Please note, there's a known IRQ bug making music to hang on some
   computers sometimes.
   Sadly, as mentioned, time is up so we'll have to live with it.


   Anyhow, some credits:

    code:	the edge
    music:	zodiak (with great help from Necros/FM)
