  technical info

    . the vesa routine halts if you select a non-existing color depth!
    . scale's linear executable compressor (le-pack) is used for smaller size
    . the particle object consists of 4481 particles of 8x8 pixels each
    . no time for code optimization - sorry!
    . the 32bpp zoomer used is a fixed point bilinear interpolated zoomer
    . all the textures and sun-flares are generated
    . the intro works well with matrox millenium i, matrox mystique and
      tseng et6000 cards, but it doesn't work correctly with a matrox
      millenium ii (at least not at the one tested!)
    . if you have problems making the intro run or find any bugs, please
      email scale right away!

  requirements:
    . approx. 8mb of free memory
    . a fast pentium pc (intel perferred - we use the fpu a lot!)
    . 32bpp or 24bpp gfx card (use univbe with matrox cards!)
