GREETS:
Mesios/Image:        for making IMAgE (www.image-zine.de)
Adok/Hugi:           for making Hugi  (hugi.home.pages.de)
Magic van Lam/d4z:   for being there to chat
Bjoern/Image:        for helping with my Amiga, which isn't running anymore
                     so good, i can start it but when i attach my floppy drive
                     it isn't booting and it makes some worse sounds :((
#coders.ger:         why? because of the infos you get there and for the time
                     idling there
#image.mag:          for hanging around
Necromailer, Markos Wunram, Marc Feininger, the Mailers and #necromailer:
                     for being a good Mail-System for everybody
                     necromailer.home.pages.de

and finally i would like to thank all the people i know, those i forgot, and
i hope i'll do anything better this year than this "demo". I think there is
enough time to do anything useful. If you think so too, send me an e-mail.

Thank you, for watching the demo and reading this info-file.
Bye
