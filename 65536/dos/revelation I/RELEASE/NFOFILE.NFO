³1.2. INTRODUCTION³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

If you are so stupid (let's say smart :) ) to read that crap, i've got some
comments for you. Just to begin with, you wouldn't see that proggy without
those people:
	Coop	      : great code (player, extender, infinite zoomer,
		        some other glass-zoom-rotator or whatever)
	Case	      : he convienced me to be a member of that group and
		        convienced Blaze to do some music
	Blaze         : MSX
	Rommel	      : uhmm..., what did he do ? yes, that's the guy who
			did a lot of desing and gfx ( :) )
	Me	      : the rest (effects till that babe picture).

This is an after party version with some minor features added and some minor
bugfixes made. This is the version we could present at the party but due to
lack of time we didn't do it. In fact it took me like one and half hour to
prepare it to a state it's in now. The rest of bugs remains unfixed cause
it's like 2 a.m. and i hardly slept yesterday and day before yesterday and
besides, to tell you the truth i'm a bit sick seeing the intro again and
again. If you wonder where that name came from i can try to explain it:
we had no slightest idea for the name of our intro so i named it after our
group's name. Besides i find cool that manner of nameing things (like one
great music band did with they albums :)).

³1B.1. REQUIREMENTS³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

Pentium II 233Mhz, 64MB RAM and so on, so on... . To tell you the truth i
have no slightest idea of requirements, the fact is that it runs on my shitty
computer (P100, 16MB, some gfx card) and on Coop's 486DX4 100, 8MB. But...!
There's only one condition to watch that presentation: 
YOU MUST HAVE A ROCKING&ROLLING GUS!!!. 
And one more thing it requires VESA 2.0, too (if you experience some problems
with gfx try running the intro with a -m or /m option, it will run slower
but there would be greater probability of avoiding gfx crashes).

³15.21. WHO WE ARE³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

You know who we are, we are just like you reading that stupid text. In fact
some guys listed in the section 1.1. are members of a quite new group called

   	                     REVELATION

I'm not sure but i think it was founded by Thorin (Equalizer BBS SysOp) in
1997. Somehow i was asked if i wanted to join the group, so i joinded and so
did Coop. For group details contact Rommel, Thorin or Case. As usual i could
do some list of our members, but i'm not sure whether i know them all :) :
