1) Introduction

The demo "MOTION" can easily be seen as a kind of "Recycling-Product",
in other words, there is nothing really new in it.
Nevertheless "MOTION" might interest you mainly because of the nice
connective effects, which in my eyes make this demo different from
others of a similar data-size. So if you have not seen the demo yet
stop reading this boring text file and enjoy "MOTION".

2) General information 

"MOTION" has been coded in TP 7.0. 85 % of the code is pure Pascal.
This might be the reason for the choice of effects, e.g. there are
no vector graphics at all. Consequently we were forced to code
in Pascal on a very high level in order to get satisfactory results.
That is why we spent so much time optimizing effects and excluding 
possible bugs. (Of course we are still not sure if there are any bugs
left.) Finally the result is quite satisfying especially regarding
the optimization. This demo requires only a 386DX for maximum speed.

As far as I can remember, our demo belongs, if you just take the
optimized speed into account, to a very few number of demos which
have similar opportunities. The main reason for the speed arrangement
was that I, SDM, have only got a 386DX40. VOXEL has got a 486DX33,
so he had to adapt to my speed level.

3) Additional information concerning the effects

The following information is given mainly because of the efforts
we made to create this "masterpiece".
In fact the whole demo group consists of two people only, so do not
focus on the columns 'Main Code' and 'Graphics' too much.

Is it not a boring list ? Please do not answer !
As a professional demo coder you might think that all the listed
data are no reason to show off. You are right, but consider that 
most of the effects have been coded in pure Pascal ! 
 
There is still another list to follow ;-):

assembler code          VOXEL
main data management    VOXEL
final code decrease     SDM/VOXEL
background song         SDM

Finally we would like to thank the following people for their
active or at least passive support:

Bresenham, Zwerg Zwack, Chicken, Element, Ion

        
THIS IS THE VERY END OF THIS TEXTFILE ....

                                                     signed, SDM          
                                                                                 
PS: Do not hesitate to watch the demo once more, because all the
random effects will change their pattern (e.g. plasma picture, 
chaos shades, landscape, starsky, chaos dots, pixelball, the sinus
plasma fade out effect and even the colour worm palette). BTW, you
have probably noticed that some effects jerk a bit. The sound might
be the reason for this. So press 'N' for 'no sound' this time , you 
will not miss anything special, anyway. Do not forget :
By pressing the "SPACE" key you can easyly skip parts you do not like.
