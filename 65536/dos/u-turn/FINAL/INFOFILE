making of this intro:
  at about 00:00 on friday night loonie started to make the tune and whizzter
  went out to boose, at 3am the tune was finished but some hour earlier
  whizzter had gone to sleep and it was impossible to wake him up.
  at about 5-6 in the morning whizzter woke up with a headache and had some
  problems with various bugs, when those were fixed at about 10am we
  finally could get started on the design, the deadline was at about 8pm
  but thanks to alot of friends we could get a extra hour(or 2? ;)
  the beginning of this intro turned out quite nice as we still had time
  then but the last parts of the partyversion was totally fucked up by
  whizzters idiotic ideas about design.
  anyway this final was put together at loonies place a few days after
  the party by whizzter and loonie(and some updated pictures by wiz)
  so now we have a intro that we are quite satisfied with.

  time in designing the party version: 8-9 hours?
  final version                      : a day or 2

 oohh.. don't forget we used rotating radial blur in this baby, how many intros
  except sad has used this before, we'd like to know!

 btw, as you prolly figured out the sb version of this intro has all textures
      and sounds unpacked.
