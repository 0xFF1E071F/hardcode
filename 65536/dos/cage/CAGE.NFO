˘chapter one... introduction:

     this production took the first place in the cache'96 intro-compo,
     which was held in kecskemet, hungary on the 8-10th march 1996.
     the second part of the work was done on the partyplace on saturday 
     morning, just couple of hours before the deadline. it was fast-made,
     unoptimized, but it still was enough to beat such phong-environment-
     cutting-190202 faced-complex object-productions, made in masses 
     nowadays...
     now here is the optimized version, bugs are fixed, and nothing else.

˘chapter two... credits :

     main code :

                  pupu and pro

         music :

                  hanx (with some optimizations from pupu)

 character set :

                  anorganic of promise!

    s3m player :

                  tsc/shock! (a bit buggy, but thanx anyway! :)))
                  (he also provided us his machine at the partyplace
                   to work on, so some extra-thanx must go to him
                   additionally...)

˘chapter three... system requirements :

    you need just a 386 processor and a vga card with monitor to watch 
    the intro. if you wanna hear something coming out from your speakers
    you have to have your gus plugged in.
    we recommend you a fast local bus vga card and a 486 machine to fully
    enjoy this production.

˘chapter four... greetings, messages, etc :

     there is no need to greet anybody, just because we want to greet
     _everybody_ we know, everybody who know us, and everybody feeling
     just like we felt at the party (tiiiiirreeddd ;))))...
     (well it's a lame excuse just to cover our fuckin lazyness :)))

˘chapter six... some sorta closing words :

     hmmm... what should we say? we hope to see everybody at scenest2 in
     april, and until then we wish you a lot of boozing, girls/boys (what
     you prefer :)), and a lot of fun on the scene, coz we all built it, 
     we all have to take care of it, else it dies.
     just a final remark : 1995 was the year of agony on the hungarian
     scene. let's make it in 1996 an other way...
