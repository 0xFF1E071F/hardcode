
        Psychic Symphony on the keys!

        It's exactly midnight... New day is 22nd October 1998

        Now it's 00:01

        Anyway... A couple weeks ago i was talking with djamm on irc
about music and i told him i was thinking of doing a small intro with
one of his old chip-tunes. He liked the idea!
        A couple days later i came upon these old graphics by iceball
when we were young and wrestless! (1 year and half ago :P)
        I had this idea of doing an RPG at the time and he did this
little cute green hair dude. Then some grass, sea, rocks, and that
little explosion (who looks more like a blob). Anyways... I came upon
these cute old graphics and asked him if i could use them. He didn't mind
so all i needed was a story...

        It's now 00:05

        ANYWAYS... I finished it!

        Don't know to what party to send this one... I'm releasing it
under Arf!Studios because this represents the 'fun in the scene'
Arf!Studios is trying to bring back! I haven't send this one to
Zippy^The Utopians and that is basically the only reason why this isn't
also an official The Utopians release aswell.

        More tolerant and fun scene! That's the message in this one! :)


        <start misc. code stuff>

        Turbo Pascal 7.0 was used to do:
        No pre-calc whatsoever
        No compression whatsoever

        X-linker was used to link together:
        the compiled exe (bout 17k)
        the gfx file     (bout 15k)
        the music file   (bout 13k)
        the gus support  (bout 12k)

        No sound sucks! So don't use it although it's available...

        More cards are supported via external .mse files. This is
because i used BWSB (1995) for sound support.

        <end misc. code stuff>


        Now comes the part i really coded this for: THE GREETINGS!

        I'm back! It's the same day only i have spent whole morning
sleeping and whole afternoon doing some math while listening to music.
        I feel empty! I should feel happy to having finished this project...
I was happy last night... But i went out of my room to get some cookies and
caught up with my dad on the kitchen... He told me to stop singing, it was
to late. I wanted to tell him i just finished this very cute 64k intro which
meant a lot to me but i couldn't. I realized he wouldn't care a damn bit!
        No worth-eating cookies on the cabinet either so i returned to my
room only with a diference. I was now not happy about releasing the intro.
Underworld was still playing since i had put it rolling while finishing the
intro... Listened to the lyrics a little. I felt bad. Watched seinfeld and
went to bed.
        Woke up, watched some music video's, eaten the soup only, back to my
room to do some math for the whole afternoon. It's now 17:47! The Verve playing
I'm skipping some tracks straight to lucky man... Done!

        Happyness... More less...
        It's just a change in something in my liberty...
        Oooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn my mind...

        Happyness... Coming and going...

        ...

        But i'm a lucky man...
        With fire in my hands...


        I should feel happy about the intro... Yet i don't feel a thing. No
one around me cares remotly on if i am happy or not...

        I just felt i had to write something else besides just greets to all
friends i have on the internet... I guess they are my only friends...

        <Oh! I'm a lucky man!>

        Humpf... G I just recalled seeing this on the telly the day i realized
i probably wasn't going to wired... who cares...

        song is over... i'm out of here...

        Psyshit















OK! So now i'm am going to try to do a reasonable infofile from here on...

        Music was provided by DJamm... It's a small 16k chip-tune he made
a couple years ago.
        Graphics were provided by Iceball. In a total of 19 frames for the
little guy, plus one unused (20*20)! 3 different trees! (40*20)
Plus 2 frames for the sea, one rock, one grass-field and one flower pot.
Also a little blue explosion which was used impersonating a foe.
        2 frame's of the sun (20*20) we're drawn by myself (Psychic) and
mirrored on code to save gfx space.
        Graphical font is a neopaint native.
        All code is pascal except for small asm (which i got hold of from
some tuturials) for mode13h switch and getkey!
        Main exe (compo entry) is an exe by x-linker which runs the main
exe, seeks pcx file, seeks music and seeks gus support!
        Other cards support are added externally... The intro can run
without them beeing present!
        The final exe file doesn't reach 60k and it's all unpacked and
uncompressed. Zip it and check the rate if you don't believe me! I am not
a size optimizer by nature since i basically don't know any assembly. But i
did try to chop down the maximum possible to include a small random distortion
on the final credits screen. Without sucess tough... Size raised near 20k!
        Also couldn't squeeze in sb support on compo version since it was 11k
long and the max i could free up was 9k! :(

        Here is what DJamm has to say about this intro:

<djamm> It was a great pleasure working on that !
<djamm> it brings me back a few years before :)
<djamm> this kind of productions should be released more often !

	END!
