                                  trouble ??

                    although emm386 works, boot himem-only 
                      unload as many drivers as possible
                       make 570kB base-memory available
                               

                               evil trouble ??

      we don't care about any damage this intro might do to your beloved
    hardware and we certainly do not pay for it, but please give us a note
       about funny things like broken harddisc, monitor, keyboard... :)


                                   info ??

    optimization for 8+8kB internal cpu-cache, Pentium's branch prediction.
      no pentium-only opcodes - actually this does run on 486DX-16, but...
            Texture-mapper is perspectively corrected each quadword.
