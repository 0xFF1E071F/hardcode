  01   OPENING WORDS


       We, the members of Surprise! Productions (S!P), are very glad 
       to welcome you to another production.

       We hope you will like and enjoy it. Please honour our work, as
       it is really a lot of "work" in every production.



  02   ABOUT THIS DEMO/PROGRAMM/RELEASE

	This is an intro for The Party IV in Denmark. Nothing here is precal-
	culated, everything is realtime done. The intro is quite slow, but
	lack of time due to commercial projects made us release this version.
	Possibly the "boost-up" version will also be released after the party.
	The slowness of this production is also an effect of that I (UNREAL)
	worked on it 1.5 week before party, and ... well, I had to do it
	short, and short=slow in this case. Sorry.
         Hmm, Do You know that there were 2 additional efx? I very nice and
        really fast plastic picture and one cube. Well, they looked nicely,
        although they didn't fit the whole design so they're off. The
        efx will be either used in mag intro or somewhere else. Next intro?
	 On more thing: I used GOldPlay, it's pretty slow, although I didn't
	have enough time neither to get any other replayer nor to make one
	EXE (now 1st contains replayer and 2nd intro exe file).

  03   RELEASE CREDITS

	No one of the effects You see in Shadow is real CPU scene effect.
	We have discovered the way to forge the mind. In reality, the 
	way of doing this is just showing some points (10-1000) in very
	special way. All rest is a delusion, You think You see e.g. zoom,
	and in reality it is just some colorful dots. We used fact that 
	human eye is very easy to cheat. Why is all the stuff so slow then?
	It is the matter of special calcs for so called
  		   How To Set Cheat Points On Your Screen (R). 
	 Mindforge code, gfx, design and ideas................ Unreal
	 Mindforge music.......................................Scorpik

	P.S. Rotation tables ;) were done with EXON's programm. Thx, Ex'y!
        P.S.2. Big thanks to Camel for Odon idea. It helped in fractalpart.





        P.S.3. HUGE thanks goes to
                                 NORBY of TRSi
                                              for delivering this stuff.

       as you make no modifications to them. Also, you must not charge
       any money for copying/spreading them.

       If you are a PD/shareware/freeware distributor, make sure to
       contact us to get a written permission to include our productions
       in your collection/library.

       If you are a PD/shareware/freeware distributor, who includes
       our productions without written permission you agree in paying
       the producer of the programm USD ($) 100.000,--

       In general, all commertial utilization of our demos without our
       written permission is strictly forbidden. This includes selling
       disks (or any other electronic media) containing our demos or
       programms. By acting against this you agree in paying the
       producer of the programm USD ($) 100.000,--



  05   DEMOS/PROGRAMMS FOR COMMERTIAL PURPOSE


       If you think our demos/programms are interesting and would like 
       us to make one for you, be welcome to contact us.

       When contacting us, include a short explanation of the kind of
       demo you are interested in. This would help us to evaluate the 
       size of the project.

       Kindly include, for example, the following information:

       o  what kind of demo effects would you be interested in

       o  are you interrested in full graphic design (pictures, logos...)

       o  if the demo should have sound, which soundcard should be
          supported (Adlib/Soundblaster/Gravis Ultrasound) and which 
          kind of music should be played

       o  how long should the demo run (in minutes approximately)

       o  where will the demo be shown and when would you like to 
          recieve it (when should it be finnished)

       o  how much you would be willing to pay for the demo

       o  are you interested in any other tool/programm from us 

       We would like to point out that our demos are no animations.
       Which means, that nearly everything you see on the screen is 
       being real-time calculated. The speed of the movement is usually
       dependant to the speed of the processor and the speed of the
       VGA-card.

       You should also know that we do not make demos for MicroSoft
       Windows due to its limitations from an assembly language
       programmers point of view.

       To contact us write to management address listed in point 11 in 
       this file.

  07   TOO MANY MEMBERS?


       In a world where distances are getting closer day by day, where
       nationalism and rasism have to be stopped, we think it is very
       important to have people with different nationality, color and
       religion together in one group.

       Because this is a great way to learn from each other, to learn 
       about other cultures and to learn to accept them.

       We have to learn that we are not white or black, moslem or jew,
       Austrian, German, Dane or whatever. Because we are all humans!
       And that's the only thing that counts.

       So respect each other, have an open mind for all new things you
       don't know yet and you will live happier...

       We see ourselves as first successfull demo-group, which got the
       attribute "international". We want to show, that friendship is
       possible all over the world. There can't be borders to stop us.

       So share your talents, complement one anothers talents and learn
       to accept each other and a better world could become one step
       closer.

  15   HOW TO BECOME A SURPRISE! DISTRIBUTION SITE?


       What we expect from you and your BBS:

       o  All ever released productions of S!P have to be online.

       o  You have to contact S!P at least once a month by calling
          the Polimorph Lights BBS.

       o  Your BBS has to be absolutely Demo-oriented, you yourself have
          to be very interested in demos and the PC demo-scene in  
          general.

       o  All S!P releases have to be free download for all users of
          your bulletin board system.

       In exchange you can expect:

       o  Your BBS (Name & Number) will be mentioned in every S!P release
          in the distribution site BBS list of this file.
  
       o  You have the chance to get all S!P releases first hand, but only
          if you are active yourself.

       What we can't guarantee but what is likely happen, is that your
       BBS will become more and more popular and its quality will 
       improve dramatically.

       Please read the above rules carefully and think twice before sending
       the following sheat to POLYMORPH LIGHTS BBS (S!P World HQ):
