------------------------------

warning?
        sorry. this intro had to fit in 65kb so that's why there's
        those massive loadings/calculations/initations RIIIGHT after
        you run it.

     ** if you can't see the borders of the screen doing the all-
        around-world-know-c64-loading-effect, then it must have jammed
        in some way.

      * first i was working with a 'big' demonstration for dmc'97
        or for VASARA'97 but due i didn't get music fast enough
        i had to make this little intro for dmc. pestilence made
        a great demo for vasara'97 instead, so i guess this is
        how it should have been.
      * supposed to be first presented at democracy'97 party held in
        finland in the change of january and february. 
      * didn't manage, lost my harddisk and so this was forgotten, until
        anarchy'97 invitation intro came out. 
      * this intro supposed to be in 80kb intro competition.
                supposed credits for all goes to sliver.
                supposed to make it in 3 days. made it.
                except adn0.96, it's by antti huovilainen.
      * it became a 65kb intro anyways..
      * this intro was supposed to win, but who knows how happened.
      * hm. made in three to four days without any inspiration. hope-
        fully there's someone who can stand this "too ugLy" intro.
      * a tunnel + a line + a font = introtrend of '96 '97. nothing
        new.
