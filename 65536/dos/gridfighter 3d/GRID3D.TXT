   Thanks for trying Gridfighter 3D! At the moment,      ş  additional code
   this can be considered a tech demo or proof of            hellmood/dSr
   concept. A full game based on this is coming soon.    ş

   GRID3D.EXE  - the game itself                               (54 812 bytes)
   SETMODE.COM - utility to initialize the Forte VFX1 3D mode      (13 bytes)
   GRID3D.TXT  - you're looking at it
   FILE_ID.DIZ - file descriptor for BBSes since it's clearly still 1992
   GRID3D.HI   - high score record; this will be automatically generated
                 after the game is run.

   GRID3D_LINUX } Native binaries for Linux & Mac OS/X. These are statically
   GRID3D_OSX   } linked and should run on most recent distros & versions
                  (x86_64 only.) By default they start in a rather small
                  window, ALT+ENTER will cycle through full-screen modes.

   REVISION HISTORY
   ----------------

   Ver. 0.F - initial OrcaJam public demo                          15.10.2017
   Ver. 1.0 - first release. Slightly rushed.                      17.10.2017
   Ver. 1.1 - fixed major rendering bug resulting in ~20-100%      18.10.2017
              speedup on most platforms
            - tweaked game balance & difficulty curves to cope with higher
              framerates
            - added 7/8/9/0 keys to adjust playfield X/Y position
            - fixed playfield position not being reset on player spawn
            - added native OS/X & Linux ports

   RUNNING THE GAME
   ----------------

   Gridfighter 3D supports a wide variety of Virtual Reality headsets
   including the Forte VFX1, Oculus Rift DK1 or compatibles, Android-based
   devices and OSVR HMDs. It runs in a DOS environment (FreeDOS, DOSBox,
   MS-DOS, PC-DOS, etc.)

   If you are using a Forte VFX1 on a real DOS machine, the VIP card MUST be
   installed and the headset connected that way. Run SETMODE.COM before start-
   ing Gridfighter 3D in order to activate side-by-side stereo mode.

   IMPORTANT: DO NOT run SETMODE.COM if you don't have a VFX1!

   To use an Oculus DK1 on a DOS machine, you must have a video card that
   supports DVI under DOS. Connect the DK1 video box to your machine's DVI
   port and select DK1 when starting the game. Do not connect any other
   VGA or DVI monitor to the machine! This has been tested and found to work
   with Nvidia Quadro2 and FX1000 cards but theoretically it should work with
   many others.

   If using DOSBox under Linux, Mac OS/X, or Windows, any headset that
   operates in extended desktop mode should be compatible. Make sure full-
   screen scaling is enabled and aspect ratio correction DISabled in
   dosbox.conf, and set the fullscreen resolution to your HMD's native
   resolution. It is generally convenient to have the headset mirror the main
   display.

   On Android-based devices any port of DOSBox should run Gridfighter 3D. It
   was tested with DOSBox Turbo on a Galaxy SII which works reasonably well.
   You will need a bluetooth or USB keyboard to control the game as it only
   accepts keyboard inputs.

   The game is capped at 20FPS but you will likely not even see that speed;
   this is due to lack of optimization. Theoretically a 286 with a 256kB EGA
   card can run it but for an enjoyable experience, at least a 200-500 MHz
   Pentium I/II or K6-2 is recommended. It has been tested on a everything
   from a 386/25 to a 1GHz PIII. Unfortunately the game has some issues with
   FreeDOS on VIA chipsets so if that is your setup you may need to make a
   boot disk with a different DOS; on Intel (e.g. i430TX or i440LX/BX) -based
   systems it will run under any typical DOS with no drama. Disable EMS
   memory managers (EMM386, QEMM, JEMM386/EX, etc.) for a small performance
   boost. For DOSBox you will likely need a modern system such as an i5 or
   i7. What can we say, it's jam code.

   Fun fact: Gridfighter 3D runs in an EGA 640x350, 16/64-colour mode with
   full double buffering AND software Z buffer!

   PLAYING THE GAME
   ----------------

   Gridfighter 3D features a 6x5x8 playfield. You may move your triangular
   player piece to any grid space. Up to eight disconcertingly-square enemies
   will start at the rear of the grid and follow you around in three
   dimensions. If an enemy rams you, you die, so it's probably wise to shoot
   them before that happens. Your shots will always fire along the Z axis
   (into & out of the playfield) in both directions and will destroy all
   enemies they contact.

   The following keys control your triangle:
                                                                 ù
            Move along      A   Move IN and
    <Ä   ->  the X and Y         OUT along      [ SPACE ]  Shoot      ù
            axes             Z  the Z axis

   In addition, you can press the following keys to change the 3D geometry
   in-game. You may need to do this to adjust the display to suit your
   headset.

    . ,  Zoom in / out      [ ]  Eye spacing    ( )  Stereo balance        o

             7, 8, 9, 0  nudge display left/down/up/right           o

             (note: text fields will not render correctly if
             you move the display completely off the screen.
             It should be obvious not to do that.)                 .
                                                                      
   ...or ESC to quit at any time.                           ù
                                                                         o
   We hope you enjoy this silly little game!      ù              o
