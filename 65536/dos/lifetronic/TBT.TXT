Q0. Which is the story of TBT ?

A0.
    In a cold night of October some guys on #demoita channel led by Swan,
    decided to form a group called The Bermuda Triangle. These guys were
    Swan (coder), Matley (musician) and BitStorm (coder). They went
    together to make an intro for an Italian BBS. But this project turned
    to a more loaded decision... to make a demo group... they chose the PC
    and started working on the intro. Then Matley caught ZioBit, a
    free-lance coder who was talking on #demoita. Matley asked him to join
    TBT and he accepted the offer, so they were 4.  Then, the next night
    Matley caught on the undernet IRC server two brothers, Alcar (an
    artist) and Jazzy (a musician). Meanwhile Dixan, ex-DNG,
    ex-varajagagagagna (or how damned it should be written) was thinking
    about joining TBT. Next, he did so. Base8 (an artist/coder) decided to
    co-operate with TBT while keeping himself independent. TBT was made up
    of 8 guys now. Swan was also the organizer, but most of the work was
    done by Matley. In those dog days another italian group died, the NiGHT
    ViSiON crew. Ice asked TBT to join him, with Crusher, Jovi and
    Tomastik. An internal round-table was held and TBT decided to join Ice
    (ascii artist). Next, Matley while was talking with Ice about 'The
    Trip' (the italian demo party which will be on 11st-13rd April, 1997)
    asked him what the NiGHT ViSiON guys that remained are doing... Ice
    re-did the original request... to join also Crusher (coder), Jovi
    (sysop) and Tomastik (musician). Matley asked the members who were on
    #bermuda what to do... they said yes. TBT was made up of 12 guys now.
    But Killer Loop (coder), a friend of Swan who was in Glamour, was
    thinking about joining TBT. Swan tried to persuade him but he chose to
    remain the same as before. Now, the group is a little changed... Swan
    is no longer the organizer and Matley took the empty position, Ice is
    an organizer, too. Dixan also joined 'The Spinning Kids' another
    Italian demo group but he didn't left TBT. Enfis (coder) joined TBT,
    going for overkill with its under-construction 3d Engine, then Jova
    (coder) which was known by Amiga fame joined. Spirit (coder) joined
    together with Terminator, too. Spirit was also in Chaotic Visions,
    another italian demo-group. But the good times don't last forever.
    Enfis left with Base8 to form another group. His 3d engine was lost but
    Jova took the opportunity to make it and Jovi was kicked out. But the
    group wasn't all that. Flagman (artist), an ex-Divina guy joined,
    showing some great samples of his work.  Now TBT is full of coders...
    we can sell'em for a nominal fee per piece :).  But remember... TBT got
    his tribute on Deathstar's world-famous demo "Claudia" which won the
    Mekka'97 party. Look to the greetings... see those three letters:
    'Tbt'? No? Then go to a good doctor :). And now the legend continues
    with 'LIFETRONIC', a 64k intro released at TIG 1997... We came #3...
    out of 4 intros... :( Control Unit won, followed by Spyral and then...
    LIFETRONIC ;). Not too bad, Crusher showed the intro before the
    votations to Randy/Ram Jam, Pellicus/Japotek, Killer Loop, Zero
    Cool/Tequila, Dr. Kappa/Spyral, Enfis/Medieval and Technolord/Chaotic
    Visions (as Crusher remembers). Except Technolord who didn't judge, all
    of them liked that...  The Japotek guys applauded once the intro
    finished and that worthed more than the Zip Drive which was the prize.
    Crusher thinks that the main attraction of the intro was the original
    Commodore 64 loader sequence, which was emulated in every detail (sorry
    for the huge borders :( ), but surprisingly enough, those heavy-duty
    coders didn't knew how Crusher did those decrunching bars on the VGA
    border... A bit of satisfaction :). After all, this two-weeks intro got
    a great feedback by those "quality" sceners, at least. Matley came #10
    with its multichannel module. #10 out of 25 :) and Swan came #9 in the
    graphic compo.

    That's all for now... Go further and enjoy the show ! :)

Q3. What are demos, anyway ?

A3. Taken and adapted from alt.sys.amiga.demos FAQ (done by H0l):

    >> Demos, (short for 'demonstrations'), are executable programs created 
    >> purely for art's sake, featuring impressive or spectacular 
    >> audiovisuals. Demos are not actually functional or interactive, in the 
    >> main, but then nor are portraits, or CDs. Perhaps you can think of a 
    >> demo as a music video on a computer, but with equal emphasis on the 
    >> visuals, the music, and the code. It's something to watch, enjoy, and 
    >> marvel at the creativity of. Demos can be beautiful. :)

    >> Please note that the PC Demos FAQ is contained on the "PC Demos 
    >> Explained" page at: 

    >> http://www.cdrom.com/pub/demos/hornet/html/demos.html
