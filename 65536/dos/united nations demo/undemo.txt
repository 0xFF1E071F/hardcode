This demo is programmed during my time as a sergeant in the United Nation 
Peace Forces (UNPF).  I worked at G3 LAND OPS BRANCH at the UNPF headquarter 
in Zagreb, Croatia from May 95 to Nov 95.  During the night shifts, we had
very little to do, so i programmed this demo in assembler.  The song that is 
played in the background is about Swedish UN soldiers who are longing home.

If you enyoy this demo, send me a postcard or a e-mail.
