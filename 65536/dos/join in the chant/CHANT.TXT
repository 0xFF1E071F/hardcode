 Bandwagon: Join in the chant
 ============================

 Assembly'98 64k intro, came 4th.
 Spread this package.

 Requires:
  386
  550K conv.
  About 1024K XMS
  VGA

 Files:
  PSS.EXE - GUS-supported version.
  PS27R.EXE - SB-supported version.

  They're in separate files cos' they use different players and different
  formats. I could squeeze them in one file, but that would make the
  "release" version over 64kb. The SB-version is not linked to the music
  nor will it be, I have no intension in supporting the MOD-format in
  the future. My SB-DMA-player used to have problems in every other
  SB-clone, so this is the DAC-player. It's slow, but it works.

 Usage:
  command line:
   /n       - force no sound
   /r:????? - use SB-rate of ????? (PSS27R.EXE)
