                This intro was originally made for Assembly'98
             demoparty but it was never shown in the compo because
              it had some serious problems finding videomodes in
              the competition machine. Because I like this intro
               quite a lot I didn't want to release it until now
             at The Party'98. I planned to make some modifications
             after Asm'98 but due to my military service I haven't
                had time so this version is almost same as the
              Asm'98 version. I hope it works now and will kick
                  some ass in the intro competition. enjoy.
