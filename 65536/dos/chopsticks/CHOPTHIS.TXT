		   sticks  ( wood, ivory,  etc )  used  by 
		   Chinese   and  Japanese  to  lift  food
		   to  the  mouth.


			     -[ Information ]-

   This is a three weeks project which competed in the REMEDY'96 intro 
   compo. We decided to make an intro for a change and this time with NO 
   vector effects ( we saved them for our forthcoming demo )! It's meant to 
   be run on a 486/66 and most of the effects run in full framerate or at 
   least in half ( no pentium intro here ). A gus is required to hear the 
   music but you can run the intro with no sound. 2 MB of XMS is required 
   and about 500 KB convential memory.

			    -[ Cascada gossip ]-

   "Nobody but someone in CDA knows how this last paragraph (7) really
    got in here or why, if you know please contact your local authorities 
    and let them know. There goes a romour that this someone might have a 
    handle that starts with an 'H' and continues with 'ellie' ..."
 
    Do you remember this one? From the MindBodySoul infofile? We have now 
    managed to decrypt the last sentence, and have come to the conclusion 
    that it must have been Roberto Chaves aka Hellraiser aka Hellie, who 
    wrote it.
 
    We have also found out that our friend Hellie often takes a bath with 
    his clothes on... Weird, isn't it?
 
    And that is not the whole story I'm afraid. We have been told that our 
    friend Erik Stridell aka Zodiak, buys a brand new Pentium 133, just to 
    flush it down the toilet... Either he must have a lot of money, or he 
    must get real kick out of it, or whatewer... 
 
    We can't forget our friend Johan Thorgren aka Zed. How's the new Robyn 
    album? 
 
    Thats about all our Omicron gossip section (C) found out...
 
    BTW, We really like Cascada VR section's attempt to make 5 flat shaded 
    polys in 160x100x16, but it really needs some more coding to be really 
    cutting edge. With some more time infront of the vectorsystem, it'll be
    ok, I'm sure. ;)
