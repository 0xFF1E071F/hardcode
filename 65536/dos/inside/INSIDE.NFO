 As you maybe noticed, the intro needs much power to run smooth. The best con-
 figuration of your computer will be as following :

 - 486 DX ( at least DX-40 )
 - SB+ ( for smoother running GUS of course )
 - some conventional memory ( 600 kB should be enough... )

 Having known the power of the party-machine ( DX2-80 or higher ) we designed 
 this intro for such a computer ;)
