        The  intro  won't  run  under Windows due to the music system. For
        best  video  performance  use  UNIVBE/SDD  6.0 or later. The video
        engine  supports  the  VESA  3.0  standard.  The music system only
        supports GUS. Due to the size of the module, 512k of GUS memory is
        required.

        Over  300k  of  instruments and over 2mb of textures are generated
        during   the   precalculation.   There   are   secret  commandline
        parameters  for  debugmode,  hidden part, and to save the textures
        and the music. Find them...

        By  the  way,  do  you  remember  our  intro  called  Sword?  Type
        "sword.exe :-)" for the hidden part. Only for Hungarians...
