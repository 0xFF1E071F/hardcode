     Chimera by Anakata
     ------------------
Released at Kindergarden 2000-1


Requires:
---------
* About 32 mb ram 
* Support for 320*200 in 24/32 bit colordepth
* Several hundred Mhz
* Win9x/dos
* Gus or no sound card. Release version supports sb.


The release version needs a-bb.xm. Compoversion does not, so
it fits in the comporules. 

This is a not  entirely finished intro intended for TG1900.
Synchronisation to the music will not be made because I dont
have my gus anymore.
