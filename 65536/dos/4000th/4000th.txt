
A Special News from the United Cracking Force:

With this release, it marks our 4000th release since 1998 and our 4603rd
since 1997 to be exact, not counting the numerous releases from years
before that. We've come a long way but eventually and slowly we've made
it. This really is a milestone for us and we're at UCF celebrating it.
Considering the fact that almost 69% of all our releases are keygens so
you can imagine we're mainly a keygen group and we intend to keep it so.
Only a few groups in history could manage to accomplish this awesome
milestone, especially in keygens, and UCF is proud to be among them.
Here's a summary list of our alltime crack stats.

			All-time Stats:
			-------------------
			 477 Patches
			 609 Serials
			2753 Keygens
			  41 Dongle Cracks
			  78 Tools
			  42 Fixes
			-------------------
			4000 Total Releases

Right here right now, just in a few words, on behalf of UCF, we want to
take this opportunity to thank our past and current members for their
support, hard work, dedication, and friendship over the years and for
making UCF the group it is today. Certainly without their works, we
wouldn't be where we are today. We also would like to thank our past
and current affiliated sites/siteops, you know who you are, for helping
us to bring and spread our releases to the world the past years. We thank
you all. We hope to keep up the good work and do what we do best is
releasing quality keygens. That is what UCF is all about - quality and
nothing else. Therefore, be assure and watch out for more quality releases
coming from your friends at UCF in the years to come.

Be The Force With Us and You,
United Cracking Force Council

PS. We're not that far from reaching our 5000th release either so we'll
    see you when we get there.
