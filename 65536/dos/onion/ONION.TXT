     this little intro was produced in less than 48 hours. that isn't
     so much time concidering that we had no routines ready when we got
     here. snooky made all the coding here at the party, he also
     generated some textures and other graphics. me, spiff made some
     graphics and phelix made the music and the onion logo. doyen produced
     the incfish (octopussy, ya' know)

     the intro doesn't use pmode and we would want you to use at least
     a 486 to view the intro. prefferably a pentium, but thats up to you.

     well, this is all from us this time, but we'll be back. we have some
     very nice project going on.
