 a pentium-optimized diabolic force production for meksym97 pc 64k intro compo
                                     -----
                     the same procedure(s) as last year



may creativity never leave you.

well, sometime ago, i said to myself 'why don't do some funny intro'
and now here is.
actually i said 'hey, there's mekka97 comin' up, so why don't do some funny
intro, win first prize, get bucks, buy alcohol n' weed n' get some fun outta
fuckin' life?'
but that's not important.
yes, this was mainly coded within 5 days before the party and during about 20
hours of non-stop-coding at the party place.
so i'm damnnnnnn tired now, fuck, and i have to write a disclaimer, they said.


                 (c) 1997 diabolic force. all rights reserved.
                    ('wanna get bored? write disclaimers.')

                 this stuff was released under the D4Z label.
                this intro is free software, but not freeware.
  if you want to put it on CD-ROM or any other digital media, you have to get
                   a written permission from diabolic force.
         any violation against this will end up in prosecution by law.

  the organizers of "Mekka/Symposium '97" are authorized to put this intro on
                      cd-rom under the above restrictions.


ok...
