  Reqs.
  -----

   VBE 2.0 and 320x??? in 16 bit is needed.
   320x400 modes are tweaked to 320x200 and 320x480 to 320x240
   (I could support 640x??? too,if someone told me how to tweak in xres.. =))
    

   You probably wonït need more than 8mb of memory,but you never know..

   And donït mess with the port-choose-arrow-thing. It has a tendancy too
   hang if you move it to fast.... and it fucks with doskey and 4dos 
   sometimes too.. bloody thing.   =)


   There are no error messages of any kind,so if something is wrong,it will
   just pop out to dos without writing anything..

   However there can only be 4 possible errors:
                                        No VBE 2.0
                                        No such mode.   (320x??? 16bit)
                                        No memory.
                                        Windows version older than 3.0

   So just verify that you have those things handy...

   The final version will have errormsgïs and it will be in vbe 1.2
   and use Midas..
   I promise.. Ah,come on.. please?!


   I still had about 5.5k space left for code and gfx,but i couldnït use
   it because Poison wasnït here to make the module longer..(true) =)
 


   tjong..


   like.. um ,ok..
