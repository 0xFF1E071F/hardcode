Message to AAP/Acme:  In case you'll  review  this intro in the next
issue of  Imphobia,  could  you  please  write correct  credits this
time? (hint: The "credits" you wrote in our Semtex City  review were
totally messed up. When in doubt, and writing for such a  widespread
magazine as Imphobia, check that the information  you're  writing is
correct.) No offense.
