So i decided not to code another line ever on my life.
Then 2 days before dreamhack i had an idea to make this intro.. :/
here we go again.. got some fast-gfx from my friend zthee
and got a 20k .mod from dixan
so i hacked it together once again and here we have another proud and joy..

actually this is a sequel to the first intro i made which also featured a
wabbit meeting an anvil. it was entitled: splat! (the truth is above us)

the sb1x.mse is addon if you wanna have sounds with sb
(you should find it on sb1x.zip so orgas dont think im cheating and disq)

intro is currently only working with gus and no sound (party version)
and only requires the .exe to run! delete the other files if you dont
believe me. its also 65.smtg bytes so i hope i dont get disqualified.
i also hope the projector doesnt interpolate blue and white or no one
will be able to read whats on the text!

greets are inside the intro.
anyways, cya later.
