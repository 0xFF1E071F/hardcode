                                 JIFS.EXE
                           Jello's LameNESS Loader

 It's not to complicated, just run JIFS.EXE and once your in it you can use
 the L,A,M, and E keys to change the palette. Just find your favorite
 palette or if you like them all so much that you can't decide, just keep
 typing L-A-M-E. Then just sit back and enjoy the wonderful graphics and the
 beautiful sound that this loader was designed to produce.
