      yeah. stash. right. well, we can do that, can't we? so, we did.
      it's called erratic and it's here for your viewing pleasure.
      ofcourse, we suck, which is why it's not as great as TBL's effort.
      do we care? nope.

      still, it's quite good, we think.
      cue some useless statistics:

      - 700k worth of music (really, no fake 4meg music on 1mb gus)
      - 3.6mb of textures (hah! jizz sucks ;))
      - realtime raytracing featuring full shadowing
      - 1mb worth of 3d-scenes
      - first ever 3d-engine with bezier fractals
      - truckloads of 2d-effects
      - design!
      - it was done in TWO weeks instead of three! HA!

      have you ever seen this kind of stuff TOGETHER in a 64kb intro?
      you've seen realtime raytracing, you've seen 3d-engines, you've seen
      2d-effects. together? hah! thought not!

      <ego mode deactivated>

      seriously though, if you like this intro we'd like you to say hi to
      us on #coders (IRCNet).

        virago: these 2 really cool logos. in quite a short time.

    ( those personal greets )

      Mucho gracias to Kenetic who's put quite some effort in doodling up
      that ascii-logo you can find at the top of this very document.

      and obviously, we'd like to smack the following people around a bit
      with a large trout:

      - METABOLIC! ALL OF YOU! LOWRES WAS BOT!!!!!
      - Rogue: RANZIGE AAP! :)
      - Jace: Ha! Nu jij weer! (Raytracing is wel cool! WELLES WELLES WELLES)

      (sarix crashes the pc, once again)

      - Nix: Wij krijgen nog een 64k windows iets dinges gevalletje van
             jou ... of MOETEN WE HET KOMEN HALEN? :)
      - Darius+Mental Profile: Maar jullie programma voor die diskette-
                               throwingcompo is ERG mooi :)
      - Green: Langs niks meer van gehoord. Komt er nog wat voor het eind
               van het millennium?
      - G-Day: Slaap zacht.
      - Sarix: Thanks for da flop.
      - Xoror+Riplin: Hee stelletje luilakken! CODEN NONDEJU! :)
      - kurt/green : thanks for the Jupiler (inopia).
      - Gday managed to get over a hundred ftp-clients in 1 hour.
      - Ehrm ... Sag still hasn't managed to get any sleep. At all.
        Which is kinda sucky.
        Though.

    ( major events in human history )

      1995: Quad arrives!
            The team consists of Sarix, Skin, Whizz-Kid, Necronomicon and
            Soundmeister.
      1996: Quad tries to impress people at x96, but fails miserably.
            "Kamikaze" ends up in 8th place, out of 12.
            However, G-Day and Darth Vader seem to be impressed, and
            they join.

            After the summer, Sarix becomes an irc-freak and meets Morgue,
            who promptly joins.
            Feeling not at all defeated, Quad tries again at biz96!
            This time, Low Profile/Arcamax and Zest/Spirit try to boost
            the quality of the demo. It shows, because less people fall
            asleep during "Perception", and Quad brings home the 6th
            place prize: nothing.

            Necronomicon also enters the raytrace compo, and wins 3rd place.

            After this, we force Inopia to join Quad by threatening to
            beat him up on a regular basis. He accepts.
            Soundmeister had to go, together with Morgue, due to low
            activity. In the meantime, Darkxceed also joins.

      1997: Barely recovered from last year's attempt at X, Quad tries
            to shock all people with "Addicted". Slight problem: Statix
            releases 303. The fact that our demo also crashes the
            partymachine didn't help either. No prize. Again.

            Necronomicon also enters the raytrace compo, and wins.
            Arzamas also wins the musiccompo with "Organic".
            Darkxceed ended up 9th with "Ya'r Mine".

            G-Day decides to join RBi, and leaves Quad.

            Just before Wired97, Quad foolishly decides to build a 64k
            intro. Extra coding muscle is needed, so Sagacity joins as
            a coder. Obviously, this didn't help, and we decide not to
            finish our 64k. After we saw JiZZ, we're glad we did.
            However, after seeing JiZZ on Jace's PC, Inopia decides to
            code a 64k intro together with Deadline/EFC. It is called
            "Phystix" and ends up in 4th place. No prizes. Once more.

            G-Day decides to rejoin Quad, while staying in RBi.

            Arzamas leaves Quad, due to lack of time. And, (if you're
            still with us): Buckshag also joins Quad, as a graphics
            artist. He's now a coder. (we're just as confused as you are)

            We get a little fed up with not winning any prizes, so we
            decide to kick some ass. "Focus" is released at Biz97 and
            promptly wins 1st place. We are amused.
            Also, continuing their partycode adventure, Deadline/EFC and
            Inopia code "Onfris" - a "different" kind of 64k intro.
            Sagacity (you know, the coder) slaps together some music in
            10 minutes, and the intro wins 2nd place. It has acquired
            cult status in The Netherlands.

            Necronomicon also enters the raytrace compo, and wins.

            Focus seemed to be a little out of focus on most computers,
            but a final version is quickly made. It only crashes at the
            end, now. (coders, can't live with them...period)

            [quad coders' meeting]
            Sagacity: "LowRes is coming up in 8 days."
            Inopia: "Oh, take these effects. Have fun."
            Sarix: "We'll never be able to produce a demo in 8 days!"
            After which "Process" won 1st place at LowRes97.

            Necronomicon doesn't enter the raytrace compo.

            Ever since Wired97, Deadline/EFC wanted to join. And since
            he has become a damn fine coder, he joins after LowRes.
            Hurrah.

            Darth Vader didn't do anything since "Addicted", so he left.

            We still didn't have a 2d-artist, though, so Cyclops joined!

            Then, when everybody is happily celebrating christmas,
            Aap/Acme asks Sagacity to code a demo for TheParty7. It is
            coded in two days (and thus not extremely optimized) but it's
            finished. Even Sarix and Inopia join in on the fun.
            It was then quickly sent to Aars (snigger) where Multiplex/Cheese
            didn't have any disks on him, so the demo didn't enter the compo.
            The demo WAS released, though, so everyone has seen it by now.
            It's called "Forever Dreaming", by the way.

      1998: Barely recovered from what was 1997, the posse decide to do a 64k
            out of sheer madness. Since every other Quad coder is busy doing
            BSP-Trees at some hotshot game-company (or simply too drunk to do
            anything...grin) Sagacity takes on full responsibility, but still
            manages to have Sarix and Inopia doing quite some work! Darkxceed
            even joins in on the fun with his 303-generator. Oh, how we like
            coding. The intro is called "Erratic", and at the time of writing
            we have no idea of it's ranking.

    ( troubleshooting )

      what? our demo contains BUGS? you insult us, Sir.
      still, if it doesn't work, try booting with just HIMEM and your
      soundcard-drivers. if you then get a grayscale demo, try running
      UniVBE as well, since your videocard doesn't have VESA2.0 support,
      then.

      if the demo crashes without an errormessage, try running it with
      the '/log' parameter and send that logfile to Sarix (address above),
      along with some description of WHERE it goes wrong, what your
      configuration is, etc etc.

      we really care, you know.

      --> HA! but not for this intro! you see, we don't have a lot of space
          in such an intro (64k, as a matter of fact), so frankly, we didn't
          put any weird emulation shit in, nor that '/log' parameter. you're
          still entitled to bother Sarix, though. he likes getting mail.

    ( fun facts )

      - Sarix and Skin live in a really way-out part of town, together with
        chickens and various other assorted farmanimals. except right now,
        because one of them is working at some bigshot game company.

      - Sagacity's ego is about as big as his coding talents. unsurprisingly,
        he's very modest.

      - Deadline had to import a windspeed-meter all the way from the USA.
        don't ask.

      - Inopia wanted to die after partying too hard. instead, we forced him
        to listen to non-punk music! we're tough like that.

      - Necronomicon finally bought a new pc after rendering on a really crap
        486dx2/66 for AGES. he has a dx4 now.

      - Cyclops is the only belgian in the group. we tease him with it.

      - G-Day is sleepy almost all the time, except when he's asleep.

      - Darkxceed has a car that is quite fast. that's why he now knows the
        results of The Party 9.

      - If you have a large penis you have the tendency to be violent, to
        repeat yourself and to be violent. FUCK, I already said that!

      - Sagacity typed this complete document and is currently recovering
        from RSI and a total nervous breakdown.
