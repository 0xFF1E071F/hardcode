
yes.  this is a 64k intro.  the algebric proof follows:


used files are

	intro.exe	27.356 bytes	code and built-in packed data
	intro#1b.mod	34.806 bytes	six channels music module

	the other files are informations files


maximum intro size is 64 kb

	64kb = 64*1024 = 65536 bytes or 65536*8 = 524288 binary digits
				     or	65536*4 = 262144 nibbles

	64kb occupies about 128 sectors in a 512k/blk MS-DOS FAT16 file
	system.


now let's compute the total size of this intro

		 11 1	
		 27356
	       + 34806
	       -------
                 62162 

according to the relation "<" in the totally (linear) ordered set "N" of the
natural numbers (aka positive integers), we know that 62162 is smaller than
the magic number 65536.

ok?

hey, don't let maths rule the scene! ;)
