	 A Propos 

		As many demo groups, we decided to spend the last two years
	years of our teen developping a mindblowing object oriented virtual
	reality raytracing realtime nurbs based vector engine.

		So after lots of months of work, we got a nice engine running
	at 97 fps on our very expensive dual-p6 computers. We were very happy
	until brioche's mouse missed a talking icon in Windows 98's exploder
	which erased the "\source\cobol\SuperVectorEngine\" directory.

		 After several collective suicide attempt, we decided to get
	back to our roots: so we based our job upon minimalism, pixelism and
	almost amateurism.  We focus on design.  That's why the code of this
	demo is totally object desoriented.

		We are sorry for the lack of music synchronization in this
	intro, maybe it's a new way of anticonformism in demoscene. :)

	 Boosters 

		Nowadays, there are lot of sceners who are proud to claim
	that they were stoned when they made their prods. Since we know that
	most of you are useless-informations addicts, here's the only official
	aspirine's booster list:

		food (burgers, pizzas, bread and fresh vegetables)
		drink (cocacola, sparkling water and beer for some)
		music (both electronic and analogic)
		demos (old school work by dEUS, Jeskola!, Razor1911, etc)
		linux (browsing kernel source code is so cooool for coders)
		tobacco (almost everyone except brioche and al-najjir)
		friendship (the essential is important as gedeon use to say)
