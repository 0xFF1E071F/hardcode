              " THE FASTEST RAY TRACING ENGINE IN THE WORLD" (sure?)
                

~Technical Requirements
        {

        - Vesa 2.0 required for hicolor modes. Runs also in B&W mode.
        
        - Needs fast PC (P133 minimum), even if it works on ours 486.

        - Tested with 8 megs, maybe works with less...

        - GUS required for sound. (check ULTRASND env.!)

	- Try 'antani.exe -?' for options (video modes and quality)

~Some infos on ray tracing engine:
        {

Pinguin started code the main engine in September 1996 on his 486dx33 (ARGH!)
The high complexity of algorithms used and the scarce performance of his
computer pushed him to improve the engine until this version.

It can handle textured planes (even clipped and holed), spheres (holed and
bumped), quadrics (even clipped). All the primitives are rendered with
ambient, phong and reflection. Light can be point, spot or fade with distance.

The keyframer supports simple translations, bezier-based movements,
object 'hide and show',BLA-BLA-BLA-BLA....(secret!)...
The FPU code isn't optimized for pentiums, since we haven't one....

We worked hard to allow compatibility with differents graphics card and
differents video modes, so that anyone could see this intro as better
his PC cans.

If you think this intro is C00L,nice or fantastic, feel free to send
beer, money, babies, hardware and pizzas to support our mission.
