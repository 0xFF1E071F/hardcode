This 64k-intro came ?th(?st/?nd) at Assembly'94 introcompo.

As always, we have to excuse ourselves for releasing such a lame and
undesigned production. Here's some of the best ones
  -it was coded mainly in one week  => bad optimizing and no design
  -beer ran out 		    => no fun...
  -cross was working his butt off   => really-quick-made gfx
  -too sunny			    => we had sumthing else to do...
  -sysostar's trip to ass'94        => no computer at ass until the night of
				       friday (thanx to sorrox for lending
				       their computer!)
  -more beer came		    => more sumthing else to do...
  -evil samurai cut off mainframe's => he had to type with his tongue
   fingers
