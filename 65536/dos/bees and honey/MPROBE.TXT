2. YESTERDAYS OF MiNDPROBE (in the order these events happened)
  Mindprobe was formed in july of 1993, but there had been co-operation
between Sysostar and Mainframe some time before that (does anyone remember
depression?). Since then, the memberlist has been almost the same  (Timo
joined us in may of 1994). At first we started to make a demo, but no one of us
had really idea what kind of product we should make: propositions came and went
(I still have 2ü different logos in my harddrive). So a demo was never
released.  Well, we all live in northern Finland  and we have much rainy  and
cold days,  so a party would be something fun: idea of Abduction 1994 had been
born.  Quickly we started to find out exactly what we would do and when. Our
first production, ABINTRO, was released in a hurry. It was ordinary  intro
with some  effects and gfx  in it with a chiptune as a soundtrack. Replay
routine was still buggy, but if we wanted people to attend to Abduction,
intro had to be released quickly.

  Abduction 1994 was a big success, at least in our own opinion.  But as
always, there are some	scenedudes who think that Abdu94 was a failure.  And
this is our answer to you: TWAS NAE A FAELUIRE.(I think my Irish is getting
better) We admit that there was _some_ problems with videoprojector, but it
didn't matter, right?

  At the Abduction,  we competed  with Unknown, a dentro which came second.
This product contained texturemapped cubes, gouraud and many other neat
effects. Since Seppo's SB-routine was buggy (and it takes to much CPUpower),
Unknown supported only GUS. Just before Assembly 94, Mindprobe expanded also
to amiga-scene when Crescent, talented composer and coder joined and founded
Mindprobe Amiga. He coded an production which is sumthing between minimusic-
disk  and intro and we released it at Assembly'94. We also competed in
64k-introcompo with Bees and Honey.

Mindprobe member-descriptions:
Ilkka "Mainframe" Jauho is the one who mainly does nothing.  Well,  he can
	    code, but what can one do to ones lazyness. Organizing nice parties
	    is one of the Ilkka's specialties, and we are thankful for that.

Seppo "Synapse" Jauho is Ilkka's 2-years-younger-littlebrother, but in talent
	    of coding with assembler he is  unsurpassed compared to his
	    BIGbrother. Seppo is the youngest member of our group and is now
	    studying mathematics at Korkalovaara's gymnasium.

Kristian "Cross" Lehtomaa is the bigmouth  mothafucker.  He draws all those
	    nice piccys and ansis.  Kristian has always strong black'n'white
	    opinions about everything and just cant keep'em with himself.
	    Kristian is also behind the design in our newest productions.

Aake "Vinyl" Otsala is the  main musician  in our group.  Usually it is Aake
	    who composes the tunes in our prods, because of the fact that
	    Mixtec and Crescent are both kinda ambientlovers and Aake's funky
	    tunes just are the one of the best ever made (at least in our
	    opinion:).

Harri "Crescent" Salokorpi handles the Amiga coding in our group. He also
	    composes ambient music in his spare time (which he unfortunately
	    doesn't have enough)

Veli-Pekka Yliniemi, also called Sysostar,  handles the net-pr and spreading
	    our latest prods. He runs our WHQ Putrefaction of Perfection.

Timo "Mixtec" Ylir„is„nen is our second  graphician/musician,  so he's quite
	    artistic guy. Recently Timo has been investigating the secrets of
	    3DS, so he's the one behind all those objects and rendered piccies.

Mindprobe Fan Club
  Mindprobe Fan Club consists of our close friend who are always partying and
boozing with us. They are also our betatesters,betacritics and betaa-petis. All
MPFC members have their own yellow MPFC t-shirt and they get our MPFC clubmag
once in every month together with starposters and signatures (noooot). To put
this in another way: they are our partyanimals.
