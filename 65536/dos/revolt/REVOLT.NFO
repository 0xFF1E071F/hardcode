(not to hard coding)...  I hope you enjoy it, don't you?
Not to many effects ( coding, drinking you see :) but true my 
HDD was crashed and all my effects was <Paradise> (L)ost...
I was very angry but in two (not to long) weeks I built my codes
again (little slow - not to optymalized becoz I didn't have time)!
