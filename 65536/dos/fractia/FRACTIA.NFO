This Intro was designed to run on fast machines this means an Dx2 66 Mhz Pc
or faster. It will lose in fluidness on an slower computer and there may
be some thrash in the imagewarping part. And of course it will run smother
on a faster machine.

This demo was coded in Turbo pascal 7.0 with some Inline assembler. Of course
if you're group programs in C or C++ thats no problem , Either we just link
