        l0ve.001        10156   6-08-96  10:10  datafile.
        l0ve.exe        21426   6-08-96  10:01  run this for l0ve.
        l0ve.s3m        30604   6-08-96  10:10  datafile.

        these files can be spread as long as there hasn't been any charge
        or modifications on them.
        
        you can include this pack into your own veryfine 'scene-cd/tape'
        but remember to notify me with e-mail: sliver@triplex.fipnet.fi
        (of coz ABDUCTION'96 organizers can include this intro into their
         party-cd if there'll be any..)
