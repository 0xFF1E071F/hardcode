        Well hello there! :)

        You just entered the fascinating world of ponies intro infofile :)

        Please take a seat and enjoy your stay =)

        psychic symphony on the keys here, i finally finished this intro,
after many troubles with the graphics and stupid bugs i finally got the
time on a happy and extremly hot afternoon to finish this intro up. this
is probably my last coding ever. (probably not) But atleast thats what i am
trying to do, finish up with coding once and for all. I already released
all my previous coding experiments on demo.cat.hu and scene.org as a free
source pack. There is nothing new on this intro.
        I don't already remember where i got the idea to do this one, i
recall something about irciing with adok about the lack of motivation to
do productions and i finally had the idea for this intro. I was supposed
to use fashion's graphics but er.. they didn't fit the style of iceball
so i didn't. Sorry girl! :)
        Either way, this was supposed to go to remedy99 but it didnt because
i mailed the organizers asking how to submit my production and they said i
needed to be there. Which was a lie since lots of people submited remotly
but who cares.. Further more, radix attended the party after all. Oh well...
Doesn't matter. Since i'm (i hope) going to hungary for antiq i though i
just take something with me =) so now i have an intro.
        The greetings are all in the end of the intro so don't bug me about
it here =) I think i must have forgotten some folks, i always do.. Sorry
about that. I still love you =)
