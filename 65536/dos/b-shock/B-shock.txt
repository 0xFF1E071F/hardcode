  -the story.
    .this intro is the sequel to our very first production "a-shock" which
    .was to be released at dialogos but didn't want to run on the compo
    .machine (and actually had very bad music).
    .unfortunately, it wasn't spread well enough on the net and even we 
    .don't really know if it has been released or not.
    .but three days before christmas, we thought about making a new intro.
    .and so the whole intro was finished even before christmas day, so it
    .was actually hacked together in two days.
    .this stuff was made in a terrible hurry, just to release this at
    .the party 9. 
    .so we hope you'll enjoy the trip.
