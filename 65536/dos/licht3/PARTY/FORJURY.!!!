
hi assembly-dudes.

this is "licht3".
by haujobb.
a contribution to the ibm-pc 64kB intro competition.

the intro needs a "dos4gw.exe" to be somewhere in the paths.

the intro supports two videomodus:
1) 320x200 in 16bit (65536 colours)
   for vesa-hicolour cards
   (univbe might help here)
2) 320x200 fakemode (320x400 register compatible)
   for non-hicolour cards (and those which just can't handle 320x200)

if the 320x200 hicolour modus does work with the installed vga & projector,
please run the intro in hicolour mode!
if hicolour is a problem in any way, select the second mode.

thanks a lot.
