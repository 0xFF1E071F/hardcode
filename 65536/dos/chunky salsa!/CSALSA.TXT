                                  Tjobing!

                  And welcome to Chunky Salsa by Hoaxers.


    This is our contribution to the 64kb intro compo at The Gathering 96,
    actually its the README file, and not the intro though.. But I guess
    you already had that figured out. (Demo freaks have a high IQ standard =)

    First of all, If you have PROBLEMS then look at the end of the file,
    and if it still wont work, try to do some of the things mentioned there.
    If that doesnt help, you have discovered a new bug, and should call
    someone.. NOT me though, coz I'm already tired of coding on it.



    How about some info about "The Making of Chunky Salsa!"?

    It was coded in about 3 weeks (2 days effective coding :) and the reason
    it took me so long to make, is the fact that Im currently in the army,
    and spent 10 of those days in the damn forrest. The other little thingy
    that caused delay: I HAVE to be in bed by 24:00, otherwise some clown
    officer wakes me up at 5:00 in the morning and I have to wash toilets
    'til duty starts. (YES, I know that for a FACT :( )
    [HEHE, an officer just entered the room and told me to go to bed, but he
    wont be back to check on me for another half hour or so.] Okie, enough
    crap about my lousy life (still have 105 days left) and more about the
    intro. It's coded on a 486 Dx2/66 With a gravis soundcard, and is designed 
    to run on a equal or faster system. Sure, It will work on a 386, but it 
    will look even worse then.



    Stuff that we used to make this demo:

    Turbo assembler 
    Turbo Pascal 
    Deluxe Paint 
    Protracker (YES, amiga module indeed.)
    1000 cigarets.
    765 gallons of coke.
    And ofcourse a braincell or two.

    As you understand by now, this is no big-budget, time-consuming, mega
    project made to impress the world, but was made just for the fun of it.
    (Although I got SOOOOOO tired of it, and had NO fun debugging it
    yesterday..)




    Maybe it's time to kick off with some greetings..

    Yups, Its that Time of the day (Or that cluster of the disk, if you will)

    First out is the NO SOUND! problem (wild applaud!)..
    If you have a gus, and dont get any sound, then simply set the ULTRASND
    enviroment..
    If you DONT have a Gus, then you have to go through these simple steps
    to run the Intro without sound, At the DOS prompt write the following:

    C:\>SET ULTRASND= A,B,1,C,3

    [A] is a free port.
    [B] is a free DMA Channel
    [C] is a free IRQ
    Just leave the numbers as they are, its only SoundBlaster/MIDI Irq and
    Dma.. It wont affect anything.

    220,1,1,5,3 Usually works unless you have a soundcard or wierd mpeg
                decoder or something installed.

    Then run the demo, And it should work.. If I got too technical for you
    just call your geek friend, and he'll fix it for you.



    The other Problem is that this intro writes one tempfile to "C:\"..
    And if you dont have a C: then things get kinda spooky.. (Drumfill)
    (The reason I dont use current dir. for the file, is because it HAD to
    be able to run from CD-ROM.. Yuck!)

    You can fix this by writing this little line at the DOS prompt.

    C:\>SUBST c: DRIVE:\PATH\IS\OPTIONAL

    [DRIVE] is a drive where your have more then 25K of free disk space.


    TO GET MAX PREFORMANCE, Remove Tsr's, QEMM .. stuff like that :)
    It will run on ALMOST any config though.. Just one thing.. DONT
    try to run this from a doswindow In WINDOWS.. coz something strange
    is bound to happen :)..




    Well, Thats it.. The official readme file.. IF you damage something by
    using this program (Hardware, Sanity, Kids, whatever) Im not going to
    give a shit. A political in-correct way of saying that you use this at
    your own risk.


    It's time to Light that last cig' and take a nap, Coz in 6 hours my
    plane leaves, and I'll be home on leave.. Then in two days I'll be
    on my way to The Gathering..See you there!
