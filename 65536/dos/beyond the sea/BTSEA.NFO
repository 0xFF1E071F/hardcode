þ Stuff

. This intro is not to be run under WinDoze (thanks to Midas)
. To run with manual sound setup try "BTSEA anyparameter"
. This intro requires 512k of  XMS  memory (pressing F5 at the boot menu
  of WinDoze should make it,  in  this  case  you'll  have  to  manually
  configure  your  sound  hardware,  because there ain't any environment
  variables (that's by them that Midas does autodetection)
