        You may not know what is Halcyon and what it does. Don't worry
        (be happy), this info-file is created for all the stupid persons
        like you, which don't know what Halcyon is.

        Oh well, I'd better start with history.. Halcyon was founded
        by Blitz and fate in 1993 (or 1992, who cares!?!?). In the
        beginning it was _VERY_ (I really mean _VERY_) lame group
        and the name was different (I wont mention the name here..).
        We released couple of products, mainly utilities, but then
        we made our first BIG mistake: we decided to make an intro
        (without any graphicians or musicians!). So, we had two
        members, both coders and we made an intro. Can you imagine
        the quality of that intro? Later in 1993 we made another
        intro, that was bullshit too. In the end of 1993 Copter
        (graphician) and Mr.BUG (musician) joined us. We changed our
        group's name. After couple of months we kicked Mr.BUG out,
        'coz he didn't do anything. PLacidity joined us as designer
        and graphician. We released X-MAS-intro (which was bullshit
        too) and CroakeR (musician) & Bass-Cadet (musician) joined
        us. It was year 1994 and we changed our group's name to Halcyon.
        Vorpal (ANSI artist) & Cabby (coder) joined us and we kicked
        Copter out, 'coz we don't like superELITES and he couldn't
        draw anything acceptable (Actually Copter left our group
        himself, but we were planning to kick him out anyway, 'coz
        he couldn't draw very well). After couple of months we realized
        that Cabby can't code and we kicked him out. Sigh joined us
        as musician and we kicked Vorpal and Bass-Cadet out too, 'coz
        Bass-Cadet didn't do anything and we realized that we don't
        need ANSI-artist. Couple months before Assembly'94 we started
        making an intro for Assembly'94 introcompetition.

        As you can see our member-status is changing all the time.
        Currently we have five members:

          CroakeR    (Jaakko Iisalo)   Musician             [78]
          Blitz      (Kimmo Kangas)    Coder                [79]
          fate       (Jukka Lehto)     Coder                [79]
          PLacidity  (Petri Lievonen)  Graphician/designer  [79]
          Sigh       (Sakari Hyrkk”)   Musician             [79]

        As you can see, we all are quite young, but I think we
        are pretty good. In the beginning, when we were lame group,
        we made mainly utilities (DOS & SBBS, which usually were
        bullshit), but now we are making mainly demos & intros.
        Ofcoz we make everything what comes to our mind.

        I won't tell you our group's older names, 'coz they
        were _LAME_ and they released _SHIT_! So, our current
        group, Halcyon, has offically born in the beginning of
        the year 1994 and it has nothing to do with older shits.


        Here is our release-list (which will be updated):

          Name          Size     DD/MM/YY  Short description
          ------------<>-------<>--------<>---------------------
          SEAGULLS.ZIP    140kb  ??/??/94  Seagulls by CroakeR (S3M)
          42      .ZIP     65kb  07/08/94  42, 64kb.intro, 386/GUS


        You should be able to find these files on our dist.sites.
        Well, here's our problem: we don't have any HQs or distros.
        So, if you want your BBS to be our HQ or just a distro, please
        contact us somehow.

        If you want to join us, it would be good if you live
        somewhere in the capital-area (p„„kaupunkiseutu, 90-area or
        whatever), Finland. That's 'coz it helps keeping contact and
        we don't like making ld-calls (long-distance, u know..)

        Wanna contact us? Well, I think it's quite difficult, 'coz
        we don't have any HQs or distros. You should try to find
        somebody of Halcyon from some BBS and leave him a message.
        You can also write to the following address:
