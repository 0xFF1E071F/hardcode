      troubleshooting

      out of memory when initalizing sound system :
      -- free more base memory. 600kb should do the trick.

      xms initialization failure :
      -- install himem.sys, or reboot. if the intro exited with an error
         before, all your xms memory has been reserved by the intro, so
         i'd reboot if i were you.

      crashes when uploading samples to gus :
      -- either free more base memory, or check your ultrasnd environment
         is correct. if you have set this, and don't have a gus, the intro
         might crash. furthermore, if you do have a gus and the settings
         are wrong, the same could happen.
