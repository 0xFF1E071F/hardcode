MAINSTREAM by MOOTTORI
64k Intro for Assembly '97 intro compo.

* Requirements

Needs maybe 300k of base memory, and doesn't run under Windows. Uses EMS if
Emm386 or Qemm is active.

A Pentium 133MHz or faster is recommended. I don't like how it looks on 486.

Asm '97 organizers! If the "big screen" is as dark as 1996, please use the
-g parameter ("m_stream -g") to brighten up colours.

* Supported sound cards

Supports GUS, SB, PAS and WSS. If none of these are found, no music will
be played. If the computer has GUS and other cards, GUS is used. Remember
to set the needed environment variables.
