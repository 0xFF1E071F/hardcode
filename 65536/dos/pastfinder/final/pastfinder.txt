pastfinder
64kb intro
first presented at
syndeecate-appocalypse 2003

code
  crs
soundtrack
  by crs very little edited
  dalezy's remix of
  rob hubbard's sid lightforce (1986)  
sound system
  midas 0.40 by sahara surfers

executing
  minimal cfg: 80386DX, 640 kb ram, vga 64kb, soundcard
  this is a dos intro so it likes 2 b executed 
  under dos or at least win9x with properly installed
  soundcard (sb or gus). it uses weird resolution of 256x200  
  (or 256x256 if you keep the num lock switched off).
  no vbe and lfb neccessary.

i would like to thank
  bass for lending me his computer for finishing this intro
  and organizing the demoparty it competed at
  all (heroes) who came and took part of it
  kenny, jezeq and spool for beating my intro in the competition :)
  activision for producing pastfinder the game
  rob hubbard for composing lightforce.sid
  dalezy for remixing it and agreement to use his tune is my intro
  ing. jiri zara for writing book of modern computer graphics
  my best friends redox, d.ment and nula for support

this is my last 64kb intro in dos, i really need to learn something else
