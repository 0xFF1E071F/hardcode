This is the source of VEX v1.1, without the sound-system and the overlay
functions.

To compile VEX you must have Borland C++ 3.1 and TASM 3.1.
Compile and link MAKESCN.CPP, MAKEDAT.CPP, MERGEPIC.CPP, CONVFNT.CPP
using the large model and call MAKEVEX.BAT.
Then use the BC project file VEX.PRJ to compile VEX (change the directories
to your configuration)

This should be all to have a running version of VEX.
