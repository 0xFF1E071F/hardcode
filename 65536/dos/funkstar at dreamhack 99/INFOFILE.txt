 have a pentium 166 at least,
 with a graphics adapter that supports 512*384*8bpp (vesa 2.0),
 and some sort of soundcard.

 gus-owners and nosound-owners run gus.exe

 if you have another soundcard just unzip others.exe and run that one.

 uhh gus.exe contains tiny gus xm player
 uhh others.exe contains midas digital audio system

 thanks to the autors, tho the midas version is very unstable ;)
