 1. Introduction

        Thanks Wasting A Little Of Your Precious Time For Reading This
        Little TextFile. Welcome in "Ambient", The aNTaReS Contribution
        To The French Party "Meeting'95". We Hope You Will Enjoy Your
        Trip Into This Nice Little (64Ko) Intro. Also, Don't Judge Too
        Hard This Little TextFile.. It's 4h In The Morning, I'm Trancing
        With "Snivilisation/Orbital", I Don't Have Coffee Anymore...
        Well, In Brief, I'm Flying In Another World........ %)

 2. Technical Information

        Stay Calm.... Relax... This Intro Is GUS Only... I Was Forced
        To Mutilate My MIDAS Sound System To Fit In The 64Ko Barrier...
        And Unfortunately, The SB Was Eating Up More Space Than GUS So...
        The SoundTrack Isn't From Us As You Will Notice In The Credits
        Because We Were Extremely Short In Time... So, I Used A Nice
        And Little Tune By The Excellent Crew E.S.S.E.N.C.E... It's
        Really Stunning And Amazing What They Could Do In 7Ko(!!!).

        This Intro Has Been Coded In BP7, Inline ASM & TASM4 Mostly On A
        Old But Still So Gooood 386SX/25. (Thanks To White Tiger For
        Lending Me It For About 3 Weeks...Night Are Soo Boring Without a
        PC ;). I Thinks It's Very Important To Code On A Slow PC. This
        Way You Will Be Able To Do A Real Optimization. You Guessed It
        ... 486 Demos Sucks! At Least Demos I Have Already Seen... 386
        Isn't Dead And Hasn't Been Fully Used Yet.

        Unfortunately, I Run Out Of Time And Wasn't Able To Fully
        Optimize My Texture-Mapped Vectors... Sorry For You, All 386Sx
        Owners, If The Organizers Didn't Release The Intro Immediately I
        Will Try To Make Things Smoother For You.

        A Little Note To Borland : When Will You Add Those Fuckin' 386
        ASM Instructions and Macros To Your Turbo(?) Pascal ??? Also,
        When Will You Remove That Stupid 64Ko Limitation For The Data
        And Code Segment? And When Will You Produce REAL 32 Bits
        Application ? ( Your MOVE Procedure is Still in 8 Bits!!!!! ).
        Or Maybe I Will Be Forced To Move To C++ Or Better Pure
        Assembler ??  NOT I Hope...

        There Is About 400Ko Of Source Code, Development Took 3 Weeks.

 3. "He! Your Fuckin' Shit Didn't Works On My PC ! This Sucks! Change It!"

        Before Sending Me BlackMail, Verify That :

        1) You Own A Valid Copy Of This Intro ( Archive Corrupted etc... )
        2) You Own At Least A 386SX
        3) You Own A 100% (hehehe) Registers Compatible VGA Card
        4) That You Have At Least 580Ko Of Free Memory
        5) That Your SoundCard Have Correct IRQ & DMA Settings
        6) You Didn't Choose A Too High Replay Rate For Your SoundCard

        If You Have Made A Bugs Report ... DIG IT!
