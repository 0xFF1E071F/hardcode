Hope you enjoyed seeing our little intro, we are very sorry that we could not
show you all that we wanted to - due to size restrictions and lack of time -
Hopefully, you'll see them in our next production :)

Everything in the demo is done realtime, this means as the demo runs, almost
everything on screen is calculated - it is not an animation.
Because of this, we ask for fairly hefty hardware requirements, I'd suggest
not running this intro unless you have at least a 486 (although it will run
on a 386)
