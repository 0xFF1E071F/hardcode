    Hi!, we are back again with this little intro we made in a hurry;)
    A break we will have from the scene becouse we need to finnish
    school, and do some homework for once. Maybe even learn to write
    english right:)


    This intro need aproximate 598k of Convential memory (we have not tested
    it with less than 598!!).

    A gravis ulrasound for sound, i dont even know if there are a no sound
    option on the player that we use (mikmod).

    A release version will be released later, because of a bad player
    the routines bugs if we use a timer, hehe. So for you that have a 486,
    or a p99 and down, please wait!:)

    The release version will be out as soon as compusphere is finnishd!
    or it will be released in the same zip file as this, you will see:)
