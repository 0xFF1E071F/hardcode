After Some hours of hard work this intro finally was finished.
The whole intro was put together at the partyplace by me (Euxinus).

Well this was another fast piece of code made for polynomial (x^4) 
in Sweden it was mostely an test ground for my new scripting system 
for 3d.

Well this intro was coded on a pentium and is optimized for the pentium
though it should work ok an a fast 486dx4 too. This Intro will probabely
run well even on a 486 dx266 though I will not promise anything.

If you for any reason want's to contact me or send me cash do so to
