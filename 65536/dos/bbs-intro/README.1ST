LAST MINUTE WORD:
The demo is too good for big machine... so if you are having a 486 dx 50
please reduce the speed; withdraw cache memory to get best resutlts.
Our Coder (Did) has optimised the routine and it works fine for XT and 286 !
Hope u can enjoy the work !

PS: AFL is in search of a great musician and a GFX man.
If you think u are the man contact our bbs or write to
