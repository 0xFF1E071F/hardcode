                          "TRAVEL"

         My contribution to 64K intro compo released
   on GENERAL PROBE 3 Party held in Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski
                           POLAND.
 
  -R-e-q-u-i-r-e-m-e-n-t-s----------------------------------
  
  Minimum system requirements: PC 486DX/100 MHz, fast PCI 
  SVGA card, Adlib/SB compatible card, about 460K free base 
  memory. (Intro should work on any 486 system, but if you have 
  less than 486DX2/66 MHz, you simply waste your time...).
  Size of (Virus free) file: 49930 Kb. 
  (There is some place in file to put something more, but
   no time for that...party tomorrow).

  -T-o-p--S-e-c-r-e-t--------------------------------------

  This intro is written in pure, 100%, super-duper, hyper,
  Turbo Pascal (...a "bit" of assembly language is used too :-)). 
  I have not enough time to optimize my code - sorry. Maybe 
  I do that after Party.
  All graphics (except gold font) is done by me, too.
  Song is written by biRD, FM player by Conqueror (THANKS guys!).
  Both I've got from Internet (They published it to public
  domain).

  I hope, my next production will be better - this is my
  first one. 

  -G-R-E-E-T-I-N-G-S---------------------------------------

  Now I want to send greetings to all computer users who
  use their machines not only to games and windows, to 
  people who try to do something, to all scene coders
  from Poland and whole world.
   
  And Remember: You run this demo on your own risk. If your 
  machine explode (or something like this...) don't ask me
  about return of money :-).
