PRODUCT

This intro was made during 48 intensive hours at "Icing '95" (held 15-18 of
June). Scout, GurgL and PleTrex attended - the other PHA members were too busy
(or lazy) to come. (Rolemaster couldn't attend since he had to go to some
sort of training camp and prepare himself for an international programming
contest.) The intro won the 64KB-compo...

REQUIREMENTS

You won't even be able to start this if you don't have a GUS, further you'll
need at least a 386SX with a standard VGA card. The intro won't run under any
386 memory managers like EMM386 and QEMM.

ABOUT THE GROUP

Phenomena (PC) was restarted about a year ago by The Big A, and PleTrex joined
after a month.
Most of the original members (at least the coders) had quit the demo
business completely, so there was a need for new members.
