	     made in a hurry and finished (?) at the partyplace




     thanks to the nice tpolm people who let us stay at their place and
		  acted as asm '97 tourist guides for us.

	    also thanks to the guy who lent echo a power cable.

		 and to jets/beam who lent us her computer.

	      and to croaker/halcyon&tpolm who did the music.



     the intro features realtime bilinear interpolation on all effects.

	 the interpolation can be turned off with the switch: -ugly

	      support for 256 color vga mode available: -asm97
