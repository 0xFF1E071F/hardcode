   This is woorlic's 1'st 64k, yeah it uses WEXT in the party version
   that SUPERB,3kSMALL,NON-OVERLAYED dos-extender that whizzter made :)

   started on the intro 2 days before the party and did nearly nothing before
   most done at party, that is why it sucks so bad.

   FreddyV/Useless - usmp is the best, what else to say? :)
                     usmp was used both in the final and party version
                     of the intro.
   Adam Seychell   - the final version of this intro uses dos32 to run under
                     vcpi/dpmi.
   Thomas Pytel    - i looked a bit in your pmode code, it was a good resource
                     when writing wext
   Till Gerken     - the tutor you had for getting into pmode is pretty good
                     but for good's sake, update it. tasm 2.0 is VERY old :)
   Sunset design   - Gfx2 is the best, simply
   JASC Software   - hope you don't mind that i don't have money to register
                     PSP, but i hope this makes up to you with commercial value
