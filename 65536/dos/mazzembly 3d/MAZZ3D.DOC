                       A Virtual REALITY Demo-Party!@#


The story thus far:

  You are Demulamu - and your dad has given you a shiny new Pentium for
 XMas.  You play around with it, and start to be creative.. making code
 in QBasic, graphics in Paintbrush, and music in your 16-bit wavetable
 multimedia soundcard's sample MIDI program.  Still, you thirst for more..
 so you check the local BBS's with your Terminal proggy, and find some 
 kewl demo and music warez.. after you find a player and some code routines
 to copy a week later, you make a break into, yes yes, the demo scene!
 But noone on the net knows about you so they won't take your warez, and
 very few are downloading your stuff off the BBS's.  Just as you are about
 to run out of hope, you see advertised on c.s.i.p.d.: 'Announcing
 Mazzembly '97 Multimedia Demo Gathering'.  You quickly grab the invitation
 and share it with your dad.. who agrees to take you there!  This could
 be your big break in the scene!  All you need is to build your eliteness
 and gain fame.  Only Mazzembly makes it possible!

Installing and running Mazz3D:

 1) Boot up DOS.
 2) Unpack it into your favorite directory.
 3) Type 'MAZZ3D' at the prompt.
 4) Press Enter. Simple, eh?

What's New Since Mazzembly (2D)?

 For you baba-cool scenedudes out there, you already know about PWP's game,
 Mazzembly '97.  Of course, this is based on that game.  There are of course
 a lot of changes since then (it will all be described later, don't panic):

 stuff added - compos, energy, eating/sleeping, maps and LOTS of other items.

 stuff taken out - sinks, phone booths, and being thrown out by organizers.

The Basic Gameplay:

 In case you haven't seen Mazz2D, or forgot how to play it, here's the idea.
 You advance through levels in the party, walking around, picking up/buying
 items, talking to others, eating, sleeping, and even attacking others.
 The goal is to accumulate the most Fame points, which you can do by
 talking to lamers when you have Elite points (Eptz), or winning compos.
 The levels do not get any harder as you progress, but a couple challenges
 are added as your Fame/Eptz grow large.

 The party starts on Friday at 10:00.  Every step/turn you take uses one
 minute.  The party ends on Sunday at 21:00 (cool Euro military time).

Keys:

 Left/Right arrow - turn left/right
 Up arrow - move forward, pick up an item, or attack who's in front of you.
 t - talk to who's in front of you.
 q - quaff, or in simple terms, drink any booze you have.
 h - heal, use first aid kits to replenish your hit points.
 s - sleep, to replenish your energy.
 d - drop (and destroy) any item in your inventory.
 m - if you have a map, press this to show it.
 l - if you have a missile launcher, use this to fire a missile. (!)
 Q/Esc - leave the party, quit the game.

Attributes:

 You'll see a lot of numbers on the screen that affect your gameplay.

  Hit Points (hitptz) - formerly known as Strength in Mazz2D, this is the
    number of points of damage you can take before you croak.  It starts
    at ten.  You can regain HP by finding/using first aid kits or advancing
    a level (one HP).  The maximum HP can be raised by buying a HP Booster 
    in a shop.
    
  Energy - a lot like HP, but instead it affects how much damage you inflict
    on an opponent.  You start at 500 and lose one energy point per move.
    You can never go below 1.  Energy is regained either by sleeping (1
    point/minute, in one hour intervals), or buy food at a snack bar to eat.
    The maximum energy can be raised by buying an Energy Booster in a shop.

  Eptz - short for Elite Points.  You can get Eptz in many ways.  The simplest
    is by talking to Elite people.  You can also trade hard disk warez, drink
    booze, or find many other little ways to gain Eptz.

  Fame - Fame is basically your game score.  As mentioned above, it can
    be done by talking to Lamers, which trades Eptz for Fame, or by winning
    compos.  Another way is to talk to a reporter while you have Eptz.
    Fame points can be lost if you talk to a qubic lamer.

Cast of Characters:

 You will come across many friends and enemies in Mazz3D.  They are the
 same ones that were in Mazz2D, but here is a description anyway.

  Elites (E) - The cool dudes at the party.  These guys are well known
    and experienced at strutting their stuff.  You can talk to them to 
    gain Eptz.  If you attack, they will fight back, but if you kill 
    them you can still gain Eptz!

  Lamers (L) - The lame game-players, vandals, and ravers at the party,
    many of them possibly friends of yours!  If you have Eptz, talking to 
    lamers will convert them to Fame points.  Lamers are easy to kill but 
    give you no points that way.

  Organizers (O) - These guys run the party and keep a watch over things.
    They won't move, but if you drink while they're around, watch out!
    They can be pretty brutal when angry.  These are the guys to talk to
    if you have a HD with stuff to enter in a competition.

  Traders (t) - Occasionally you'll see some of these dudes around.  If
    you have a hard drive with fresh warez, you can trade it with them and
    be more elite!  They're as easy to kill as lamers, again no reward.

  Reporters (R) - Once in a while you'll see a reporter around.  Talking
    to them can be very rewarding.  You can't attack them.

  Qubic Lamers (q) - Also known as 'Q-Bitches', these are various girls
    who got in free, because they're some elite dude's girlfriend or they
    just wanna rave and flirt with game-lamers.  You'll only see them around
    when you become famous.  They won't harm you, but they make your life
    really annoying.  Better not attack them, or else Elites will get pissed.

Items:

 This is what seperates Mazz3D from 2D.  Here's a list of stuff you may
 find around the levels.

  $ - money!  You'll need this if you want to buy anything.

  1 - snack bar. Here you can buy various food/drinks to keep up your energy.
  
  2 - shop. You can buy lots of cool items here that you couldn't normally
      find. They are described later on.
  
  ! - booze. Wanna get drunk? Pick up one of these. Press 'q' to drink one.

  + - first aid kit, handy when you're low in hit points. Press 'h' to
      use one.

  [ - hard drive.  Trade these with traders and enter them in compos.
      You'll see them in inventory as "HD:w## g## m# d###". This means -
        w - hours new your warez are
        g - new colors for your compo graphics
        m - new channels for your compo music
        d - new polys for your compo demo

  > - stairs to the next level.

  * - 'Ztarz'. When you get very elite you may need to find these to
      advance to the next level. Just another Mazz2D tradition. 

Special Items:

 Here is the stuff you can buy in a store, of course at inflated prices:

  Compass - gives you a directional heading. $30.
  Scanner - gives you a little 4x5 overhead display of whereever you walk.
            $70.
  Short-range Radar - shows the sprites in the 10x10 area you are centered
                      in, and their distance from you. $90.
  Long-range Radar - same thing, but in a 20x20 area! $180.
  Level Map - gives you a 30x30 map of the level you're on. Press 'm' to
              see it. Gets destroyed on the next level. $200.
  Full Map set - gives you maps for every level you are on! $550. Not cheap.
  Q-bitch Repellent - handy item, keeps the qubic lamers off you. $175.
  Missile Launcher - state of the art anti-scene warfare.  Press 'l' whenever
                     you see someone in front of you (up to 3 blocks away).
                     Does the same damage as point blank, so it's affected
                     by your energy.  $225.
  Hit Point Booster - adds a couple points to your maximum hit points. You
                      can use more than one of these accumulatively. $200.
  Energy Point Booster - adds 100 to your maximum energy points. You can
                         use more than one of these accumulatively. $200.

Compos:

 Yes, here is the long waited addition to Mazzembly!  The party has these
 competitions:

   Graphics - Saturday 10:00 - you can use up to 256 colors, the more you
     have the higher you can place.
   Music - Saturday 20:00 - you can use up to 32 channels, the more you
     have the higher you can place.
   Demos - Sunday 12:00 - there are no limits in the game.  Of course,
     the more phong polys you use, the higher you can place.

 To enter a competition, get a hard drive (listed above) and give it to
 an organizer by talking to him.  Of course the more hard drives you 
 enter, the better your entries will be and the more likely you will win.
