Music by Oce. All code except Module-player and 50hz mode
by Credex. NoSound is not timed at all. NoSound sucks! 50hz mode by
Liket!

Code:    Credex (+3d objs+font)

         Coded on a 486-66Mhz, and should run perfectly fine
         on one! Soundcard almost required!

Music:   Oce (50k Module)

Mod-Player:

                     Bells, Whistles, and Sound Boards
