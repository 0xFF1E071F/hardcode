;
; 1.) DRAWING TECHNIQUE
; We use the  "Set Pixel" function of interrupt 0x10
; CX = x, DX = y , AL = color, AH = 0x0C (set pixel)
; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_10H
;
; NOTE : Depending on the Graphics BIOS, you might
; see different results when plotting negative
; coordinates, or exceeding the legal amount of
; colors. Here, one underflow is accepted, the other
; is catched with a signed flag branch
; "sub cx,dx" + "js Skip" = don't draw on negative x
;
; 2.) THE FRACTAL
; We use a simple iterated function system (IFS)
; consisting of two functions with equal probability.
; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system
; We use a discrete, scaled up version to save space.
; This also fits the drawing technique in a good way.

;
; NOTE : Obviously keeping both functions similar
; and having coefficients of "0.5" enables binary
; commands (arithmetic shift!) and uses little space.

; the fractal is located on the plane (clipping!)
; separate coefficients with commas there, and
; supress probability, then hit "Correct Input"
; 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5,  0, 0
; 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -1, 0
; Adjust xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax and hit "Draw"
;
; 3.) MAKING THE CHAOS PREDICTABLE
; Normally, to implement the "chaos game" version
; of iterated function systems, you would need a
; random number generator. To be precise, you would
; need a VERY GOOD one, as carefully pointed out by 
; Peitgen, JÃ¼rgens and Saupe in "Chaos and Fractals:
; New Frontiers of Science" (just google for "random
; number generator pitfall") Surprisingly enough, if
; done right, one doesn't need ANY rng - at all!
; The secret lies in converting the chaotic infinite 
; real number system into a deterministic, finite, 
; discrete system with a rather short period, somewhat
; like a "knights tour" on a chess board. In other words,
; we need a function F which we apply N times to a point P
; so that 
;		F(F(F(F ... F(P)))) = F^N(P) = P
; and so that every pixel on the plane inside the fractal
; is actually "visited" once per cycle. It turns out, that
; at least one such function exists (several, actually), 
; characterized by the magic number 0x533, and the branching
; criteria "sum of x and y is even" (checking the carry
; flag after "add dx,cx" and "sar dx,1") Currently, i 
; dont't know exactly what "magic numbers" produce stable
; plane filling cycles, how they are connected to the 
; branching criteria, or how to find them, other than by
; trying. I'll leave that for later - or for the
; mathemagicians amongst us ;)
;
; TL/DR : the final function is both : the fractal, as well
; as the random number generator it needs =)
;
; NOTE : Every pixel is drawn once per cycle, with the very
; same color each cycle, which makes it a rather still image.
; The "noise effect" happens due to the drawing technique,
; different points of the fractal are projected to the same
; screen coordinates.
;
; 4.) COLORING
; The idea is to code the branching history directly
; into the pixel color, so that all pixels which branched
; equally in their last 4 iterations are plotted with the
; same color. "shl ax,1" keeps all the iteration history,
; except one (the oldest), and the free (lowest) bit is
; marked according to the latest. "inc ax" is just
; a shorter version of the more comprehensive "or ax,1"
;
; This has been used in "Dragon Fade", and generates
; very regular color structures. To achieve a mixture
; between random and regular structures, we can use the
; fact, that we have several ways to initialize the graphic
; mode to 0x12 from an initial emtpy AL, "xor" beeing one
; of them. "xor al, 0x12" works together with "shl ax,1"
; as a minimized xorshift randomizer, which is yet still
; dominated by the regularity of the branching history.
; "aam ??" is a tuneable coloring parameter. 
;
; NOTE : "aam ??" and skipping the drawing of certain
; points, while keeping track of iteration history, lifts
; the coloring beyond simple predictability. At this point,
; i stopped analyzing and was satisfied with the
; tuning parameters i found ;)
;
; 5.) USER EXIT FUNCTION
; Normally, you would use the infamous "in al,0x60" to
; check if the user wants to ESCape. Unfortunately, AL
; holds the current pixel color all the time, so that
; at least two bytes (push ax,pop ax) would be needed
; to do it that way. Luckily, MSDOS provides another 
; function to check the keyboard, modifying the Zero Flag
; if some key was pressed. And since a simple "mov" does
; not alter that flag, we can smoothly weave that into
; the code. Still, all together this takes up 5 bytes,
; and i am somewhat happy, that there was enough space
; to include this.
; http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-1755.htm
;
; 6.) ADDITIONAL NOTES
; The fading effect of "Dragon Fade" is actually just
; a well tuned coloring function. Since every pixel is
; "touched once" per cycle, and colors above 0x80 are
; "xor"ed onto the screen, you just need to make sure,
; that the color function remains constant for each
; pixel (for consecutive iterations).
; http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0127.HTM
;
; To be independent from "magic numbers", you can delay
; the iteration history. You basically choose the function
; by the branch another pixel took X iterations ago. Simply
; "rcr bp,1" or "rcr ebp,1" does the trick (between generating
; and checking the carry flag). This advanced selection
; is used in "autumn". It is basically needed there, because
; the average achieved period is way too low to cover every
; pixel of the screen. Just change the delay from 32 to 16 by
; replacing "rcr ebp,1" with "rcr bp,1" to see what i mean.
; Note, that even if you don't get total garbage with "unlucky"
; numbers using this technique, some numbers still do better
; than others. But the chance to find one, and the overall
; screen coverage is really heavily increased.
;
; Note, that besides clever usage of just one call to
; int 0x10 and some flag shenanigans (carry, sign, zero)
; no real "dirty" tricks have been used here, like, odd
; alignment, self modifying code etc. Checking politely
; for a key and quitting takes up 5 bytes, "sub cx,0x533"
; occupies a whooping 4 bytes, and in fact the shortest
; fading dragon i can come up with, is 23 bytes long.
; What i want to point out is, this is nowhere near the
; limit, when we think 32b, and i think, it can be MUCH
; more impressive when we think 64b (think about a lot
; better "autumn").
