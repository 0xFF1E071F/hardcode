a 32b MSDOS tiny intro
by HellMood / DESiRE
coded for fun in July 2016

-------------------------------------------

pushing borders in the 32b category

this time:

grayscale vector animation, synced to a
simple melody coming from the good old
pc speakers =) coupled to the system timer
so the speed is constant on all systems

subwoofer recommended ^^

there is three bytes left, so plenty of
space to enhance/modify if you like ^^

the .asm file contains basic comments so
you get a rough idea about what i'm doing
if you have special questions about really
anything, just send me a mail =)

-------------------------------------------

tested on DosBox 0.74

tested on MsDos and NTVDM as well, but out
of the box, both modern PCs with MsDos and
Windows XP machines with standard drivers
don't play on / emulate PC speakers correctly

If somebody gets this to work on a real old
PC system with speakers, i'd happy to be
messaged about it ;)
