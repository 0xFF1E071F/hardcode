;Dynamic T-square fractal in 32b
;For this fractal we coverthe plane
;with squares 2^n x 2^n
;and count for each pixel how many times
;it under the border or middle part of these squares.
;In terms of binary code we need to
;take x and y, find the pairs of sequental equal (or non-equal) bit pairs
;at each position, AND it for x and y and count the number or 1's.
;Enjoy!
