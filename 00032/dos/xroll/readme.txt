"Xroll" by HellMood / DESiRE
released February 2015

32 Byte Demo for Dos. 
Just some psychedelic scrolling
with fake color cycling =)

I'm not in the mood to write a
superlong explaination of dirty
ASM tricks today. So if you have
any question just ask in the 
Pouet Thread or send me a mail.

Squeezing "ESC" into the prod 
wasn't possible this time, but
in case "ESC" support is super-
important to you, go with the
"xrollesc.com" version, which is
even one byte shorter ;)

Greetings to every DESiRE member
and the entire sizecoding posse
You know who you are =)
