Before you vote, please have a look at the code. As you may notice, it
replicates to the video segment and continues replication there. So the pixels
you watch on the screen are the actual code bytes being run by the CPU, as it
spreads across the screen. This entry might not be the best graphics-wise, but
it is imho the coolest one, with respect to the code and what it does.
