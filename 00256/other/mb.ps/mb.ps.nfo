Stack-based languages are fun!
Hardware this prod is supposed to run
is a PostScript-capable printer.
As well you can generate image by
GhostScript (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/)
or Adobe Acrobat Distiller.

There are some PostScript Mandelbrot realizations,
the smallest i can find is 289 bytes:

My version is 250 bytes.
Enjoy!

Tested on real printer.
Your printer must be able to process PS.
There are several ways to run it on printer,
e.g. (Windows)
1. Share you printer
2. Map it to the port lpt1:
net use lpt1: \\your_ip_or_127.0.0.1\printer_name
3. Send .ps to the lpt1:
copy /b mb.ps lpt1
4. Wait.
In contrast to GhostScript or Adobe distiller
'showpage' must be terminated with 
Space (20h), Carriage Return (0Dh) or \0 (or something else?).
CR terminated mbt.ps was added.
Or you can send non-terminated version and after
send another document to print.
