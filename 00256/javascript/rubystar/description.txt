"RubyStar" by FPS

Usign arrow keys (up, down, left, right) rotate the Ruby Star
along X- and Y-axes. This is a sample of how you can build
3D-shapes by VML (not VRML!). In source code you may change
O:SPT and FILLCOLOR attributes to alter a shape and a color of
figure.
Tested on IE 5/Win98SE, IE 5.5/WinME, IE 6/WinXP.
