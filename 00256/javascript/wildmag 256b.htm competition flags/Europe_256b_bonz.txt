With everybody talking of flags on the one-liner :-) I decided
to add another entry -- a flag, you got it. Impressed by the
recent adoption of the euro as the only currency in Europe (and
more importantly, because I wanted to do it without GIFs, and
stars are easily done in Wingdings :-) I decided for a European
flag.

There's nothing really interesting in this little file, except that I
used <style> so that, at once, I could set the background/foreground
colors, enable absolute positioning for all <p> tags, and save a "style"
attribute for the <p> tag enclosing the euro symbol.

Now I'm quite puzzled at why CSS for 256b.htm work first time, and I never
(I say never) get them right on both Netscape and IE at work...

Of course, since I had a few spare bytes, the produced HTML can be
validated as XHTML 1.0!
