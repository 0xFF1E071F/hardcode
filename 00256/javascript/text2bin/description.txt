"text2bin" by mados
http://wildmag.de/mados

This is a remake of two the5k.org entries,
"text2binary converter"
(check http://the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=819)
and "binary string encoder"
(check http://the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=1247)
Both have very nice graphical user interfaces but no
possibility to convert text both ways.
