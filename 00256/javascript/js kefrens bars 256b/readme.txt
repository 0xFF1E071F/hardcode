JS Kefrens Bars 256b by Clash

Not another 256b from Clash?! :) Ok ok, our first demo is on the way. But I hope
you don't mind this little piece of code.There is a bonus in the package. Bonus
is 266b and it was my real goal. Unfortunately, after reducing 22 bytes from 288
bytes to 266 bytes, I was out of optimizations which pushed me to make some
changes on the effect. This is why I release the bonus. See what I couldn't fit
in 256 bytes :)

p.s: "!" files are gif images and total sizes are calculated by adding image
sizes to html sizes. (222+34=256b , 224+42=266b)

Code:
Skate/Clash

Supported Browsers:
Internet Explorer 6+
Firefox 2+
Rest of the browsers are not tested

Trivia:
I cut off the last 2 bytes of GIF images and they've worked on both IE and FF.
But when I cut one more byte, it still worked on IE but failed on FF. So, I
didn't use this 1 more byte to keep FF support. But we can assume that it's
255b on IE and 256b on FF ;)
