well, I was interested in this compo, but I had not much 
time and energy for making this entry...
it's only a simple (a bit random) julia set drawer.
256b is not sooo much in html :) and my knowledge is not so great

GREETS go to everyone especially
 - mados  (good compo, I wanted to do more, but... sniff... :,-(
	         I hope it was not your last crazy compo idea =))
 - insomniac (256b intros rulessssssss)
 - baze,silique (just because I soooooo admire their 256b intros)
 - optimus
 - alvaro axwellan & mogyi of da molecoola team
 - blala
 - Adok & all hugicompo participants (though I didn't start the current compo...
 and deadline is no near. mea culpa... I had to work)
 - EVERYONE who did or like or ever saw a 256b or 64b or 128b or 512b or 1k or 4k or 64k intro :)
   ...but especially active 256b coders...

256b compos rules!!!
