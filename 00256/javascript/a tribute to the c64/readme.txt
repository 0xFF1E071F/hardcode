"A tribute to the C64" by Sdw (Andreas Gustafsson)

This is an entry for the Wildmag 256b.htm competition.

Well I'm normally a coder and have very little experience in html/web design,
but I thought this would be fun to try for a change. 
There are two versions, one that only works in Internet Explorer (but has
nicer colors etc.) and one that should work in most browsers.
To get the best effect you should view this with a rather narrow browser window.
Thanks to mados for optimization tips and other ideas.

at webdesign! :))
