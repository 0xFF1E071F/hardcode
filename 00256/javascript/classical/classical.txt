requires IE..(and some speakers)
dunno which version, probably 4 upwards..

161 byte html file, and 94 byte midi..


comments:
the html doesn't even have any script and is not a wonderpeice at all..
with 161 bytes i couldn't do much really.. i just wanted something thatwould
fill the screen, and have a consistant feel. My goal was to create something
that had a demo feel and demostyle to a point, and we as a bit of uniqueness
also my goal was to create something with music.. when i started i figured 
i'd give myself
156 bytes for the html and 100 bytes for the midi.
i got pretty close.. i made the midi in modplugtracker, then exported it to a midi
and in another program stripped out the addition 2 channels not used and renamed Track 1
to A and track 2 to B to get a few more bytes down.. the song only contains 9 notes (and
an addition note to make sure IE doesn't cut short the pattern).

so the theme is CLASSICAL..
the message (the 5 webdings) represents the Holy Spirit Blowing, and Jesus loving the 
world.
