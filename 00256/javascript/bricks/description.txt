This intro is a LEGO(tm) construction kit.
Click on the background to summon a brick in the top left corner
Drag'n drop the brick(s) to make any LEGO(tm)ish construction
you want ( i.e. a dinosaure, a castle, a bus, a rocket... )
I'd be glad if you send me a snapshot of your constructions by
mail, and will put them no my site >__<
Hope you like it.
