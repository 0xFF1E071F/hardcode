Hi there =) A little something i sofapartycoded some minutes ago ;) It plays MUSIC so please execute with DosBox (WinXP would work too) I'll include some sreenshots so you see what it should look like and a mp3 file so hear what it should sound like. Please use a freshly started DosBox, and restart DosBox also for the next entry (timer interrupt modifications). Thanks for allowing remotes and happy partying! ♥
