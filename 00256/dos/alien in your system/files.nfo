        This is  kind  of  dirty I  know.
        Directly  to the  screen  without
        buffering and a lot of flickering
        and  noise. the  first  idea  was
        different but then it changed. so
        i added some extra noise. well at
        least there is  ESC-support and a
        correct  return  to  textmode  (;

        I also included 4 versions of the
        intro  (alien1 / alien2 / rainbow
        / shred) just  for  completeness.
        how to generate them is noted  in
        the source. [  //  / sensenstahl]
