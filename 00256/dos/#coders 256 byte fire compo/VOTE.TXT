#coders 256 byte fire compo

[What is it?]
This is an internet competition to see who can code the best fire effect in
256 bytes. Your job is to vote for the entries that you like best, and email
your vote to me.

[How do i vote?]
1. Run the program 'vote.exe'
2. view all the entries
3. -pick 1st place
   -pick 2nd place
   -pick 3rd place
4. fill in your details in the vote form generated by the vote program
5. send this voting form into <gfiedler@ug.cs.su.oz.au> before the closing
   date 5th June 1996.


[Hey! The vote program doesnt work!]
Ummm... whoops :)
Yeah, on some older monitors the video mode wont work so:
1. Buy a new monitor
2. Run all the entries manually and email the filename of 1st/2nd/3rd place
   along with your name, handle & email address.

Useless program parameters *8)

'vote 32'   - attempts to use VESA 2.0 320x200 32bpp mode w. LFB
'vote 24'   - attempts 24bpp mode...
'vote 16'   - blah blah ...
'vote 15'   - um.. take a guess ;)
'vote FAKE' - forces VGA TrueColor fake
'vote LIST' - lists all VESA 2.0 graphics modes (if any)
(note.. vote.exe automatically uses the best graphics mode available)

BTW.
If you have UniVBE installed make sure its version 5.2 or better
because previous versions of UniVBE dont have support for low-resolution
high-color modes. (go to www.scitechsoft.com)

Greets to all the cool guys on #coders
esp.Goblin, for his help with this production.



Happy voting!
