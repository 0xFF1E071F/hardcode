Subject: 256 Byte Contest! :)


Nice contest idea, it was certainly a fun one that didn't take up too 
much time... :) Here's my entry, attached as a .COM file, 251 bytes in 
size...  It's based after the light-bike scene in the Disney movie Tron 
(my favorite movie of course;)...  It's a two player game, and the object 
is fairly simple; kill your opponent or die trying.  You and your 
opponent ride in "light-bikes", something like a motorcycle which leave a 
deadly wall of energy behind you, a trail...  If anyone hits such a 
trail, be it your own trail or another bikes trail, you die.  It's a fast 
paced head-to-head action game, as you can never stop your bike, there 
are no brakes.  You've got to try and box in your opponent, forcing him 
to collide with an energy trail, before he succeeds in doing the same to 
you.  Find a friend or family member to play with you, since you really 
can't enjoy it alone; it's meant to be a fun game to play against another 
player - I'd have put in modem support and some bitmapped graphics 
instead of just single pixel bikes, but... :} Anyone, let me know what 
you think, I hope you enjoy beating up on your friends by blowing em off 
the screen...  ;)  Here's the commands you'll need to play the game:

** NOTE: Make sure CAPS LOCK is OFF or player 1 will not respond!

When you first run the game, it draws the energy border around the 
screen, and waits for you to select a game-play speed.  The faster the 
speed, the faster the bikes move, and the more adept you have to be in 
order to avoid a fatal collision.  Start slower, and experiment!  To 
start the game, enter a speed by pressing a number key, from 0-9, with 0 
being the fastest speed and 9 being the slowest.

Once you select a speed, the game starts immediately; player 1 controls 
the blue car, starting on the left, and player 2 controls the red car, 
starting on the right.  Each player has two controls, turn left and turn 
right; each rotates the player 90 degrees in the desired direction (left 
= turn 90 degrees counter-clockwise, right = turn 90 degrees clockwise)...

Player 1						Player 2
--------						--------

   q			Turn Left			   [
   w			Turn Right			   ]

When one player crashes, the game beeps and freezes, allowing you to 
contemplate your mistake; exit to DOS by pressing any key, and then be 
sure to play again and try a different game speed, or go for a rematch... 
:) Hope you enjoy it, please confirm everything got through all right, 
and if you get a chance, let me know what you think... :) Thanks for the 
fun of the contest, I enjoyed it, talk to ya later...
