Overview
========
This game was programmed for a 256 bytes worm competition invented by Zaifrun,
Gnome and I, BitSwitch. For unknown reasons I've decided to call my executable
WORM256.COM, but feel free to rename the sucker... Please note that this game
is take-it-and-distribute-it-or-leave-it-ware, which means that you'll have to
do your best to distribute the game (with any accompanying files) or leave it
alone.


Developing the Game
===================
When I designed the game I decided to make it as enjoyable to play as possible.
To achieve this I've implemented the following things:
- a genuine scoring system
- a head to head collision detection routine (sounds good, huh?)
- the black-evil-kill-your-mama-with-an-axe-worms


Controls
========  
Action		Player 1	Player 2
----------------------------------------
up		up		w
down		down		s
left		left		a
right		right		d
quit		esc		esc 

Please note: You'll have to press space to start a new "round". The reason
for implementing this is to make sure no player starts a new game by accident.


Winning the Game
================
There are several ways of winning the game. These includes:
- make your opponent collide with anything app. 40 times  
- insult your opponent until he/she refuses to play any further
- feed a puppy to some kind of hungry animal


Known Bugs
==========
- runs perfectly under Windows 95 and Windows 3.x! (grin)
- ctrl-break will surely kill this beauty
- some memory managers just don't like my programming methods


Contacting the Programmer
=========================
- If you find my game abusive and stupid I would advise you to 
  mail me and insult me. 
- If the strange thing should happen that you like my game and
  would like get the latest update, just mail me, and I'll send
  it to you. 
- If you want to get the source code to this silly little program
  just mail and I'll send it free of charge.
