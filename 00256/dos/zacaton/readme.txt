type:  256b DOS-intro

code:  sensenstahl

notes for the amazing compo team:

- about 80.000 cycles are fine at
  DosBox (comparison video was grabbed
  at that speed with core: dynamic)

- hit any key to exit + return to
  DOS prompt (textmode will be restored)

- a little background-story can be found
  in the .nfo :)
