Subject: 256byte compo.


G'day, 

   Here is my contribution for the 256 byte game competition.

You wont believe me, (until you see the program), that this is my first
ever VGA program. Once you see it, you will believe me.

Arrow keys control the line, if you hit yourself or any part of the border,
you die, quits to dos and gives a score in characters. (you gotta see it...)

Was written on a 386sx 16. If it is being played on a 386'40 or faster
enter DEBUG, (I forget the location...) so un-assmeble around 1d0.
There should a "???? MOV CX, 2000". Change this to "MOV CX, 3000" - for a
386'40.

PS: Would it be possible for you to upload all of the winners to some ftp 
site, and to post, (please?) the winner on C.S.I.P.Demos? 256 bytes aint
much...


Thanks for your time, 
Dave Maunder.
