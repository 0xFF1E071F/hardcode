This entry for the 256 byte game compo is an 80x25 text screen breakout type
game.

It features bouncing correctly off sides and tops and bottoms of bricks.
IE:  If you hit a brick on the edge it will bounce off the side, unlike most
crap breakout type games.

The speed of the ball will change depending on where the ball hits the paddle.
Imagine the paddle is curved.  This can be dangerous if you hit the ball in
such a way as to increase the speed the same way too many times and the paddle
can no longer keep up.  I would have added a maximum but I ran out of space :)

The speed of the game is machine independant and will screw up your dos clock
by a factor of 4 during play.

Special keyboard handler so you don't have to wait for key repeats to set in,
and any set of arrow keys work.

NOTE:  Collisions are processed vertically then horizontally, so the ball must
       be above the paddle BEFORE it hits it, otherwise it will simply bounce
       off the edge.
