This is my entry to the 7th (it was the 7th wasnt it!?!?!) at
http://asmcompo.dimebar.net/

I started this on Thursday, 15th of May, and finished it Friday 17th of May.
I tried to make a floormapper but it didnt quite work out. I first made this
in a HLL in asm-like style code and ported it to nasm styled asm and then
started changing it and such, showed it to efnet -> #asm on IRC and they
helped me out (thnx). Then it got a few bytes smaller and then I just
added rotation and it looked a bit better and decided id fill the rest of
the space up with a message so uh yeah.
