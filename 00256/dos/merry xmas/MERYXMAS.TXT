MERYXMAS.TXT

If you don't recognize the tune being played, try running from a DOS
prompt (either under Windoze or in pure DOS). Fourteen extra bytes of
code were added in an attempt to make this program compatible with
Windoze, but it still isn't 100%.

I am completely baffled why about 30% of the notes disappear when running
under some configurations of Win98 (such as from WinZip). It would be
easer to understand if the overall timing were affected, but it isn't.
Something very strange is going on with direct port I/O.

Anyway the X-Mas Compo deadline is near, and I'm tired of chasing this
bizarre problem. The altered tune doesn't sound all that bad anymore.
