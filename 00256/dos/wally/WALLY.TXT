                                  ===========


    This is my entry in the 256 byte game competition. It's called wally,
  and is an 'arcanoid' clone (if you remember such an ancient game...).
  The goal of the game is not to let fall the ball of the screen and hit
  the as many bricks as you can. Start the game (WALLY.COM) and you'll
  know what to do...


   Controls :
  ------------

    Use arrow keys (,) to move left and right. Pressing ESC will
  end the program immediately.


   Hardware requirements :
  -------------------------

    - Processor : min. 80286 (not tested on a 80486, maybe it will be
       too fast.)

    - Grafix card : VGA.

    - Disk space : 253 bytes.


  Have fun !
