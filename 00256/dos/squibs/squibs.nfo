Squibs 256b for MS-DOS
October 2014

So this is a little particle system with flares and trails. Not enough
space for a full greyscale palette in this one, so had to make do with
the default 16 grey colours.

Greets go out to: Harekiet, matja, bart^xt, comrade, and vprolix

Special thanks to HellMood for showing me some neat optimization tricks
for my last demo, some of which found their way into this new one.
