FLAME - a 160 byte fire effect by Gaffer/PRoMETHEUS '96
-------------------------------------------------------

I originally coded this as an entry for the #coders 256 byte fire compo,
but i figured that i probably shouldnt enter it since i was counting the
votes :)

Check out the 256 byte fire compo results!

Soon after i started tinkering around a bit, and reduced my 256 byte version
to 184 bytes, and being pretty pleased with myself, i released it :)
I was pretty sure that 184 bytes was the smallest i could get it, but 
nooooooooooo! TANSTATSC!

A few days ago i got bored doing 3d engine code and i started fooling
around with the flame code again... after a day or two of tinkering i 
managed to reduce it to 160 bytes - without sacrificing image 
quality! w00p! :)

for the last day or two i've been unable to get it any smaller, 
so i've decided to release the 160 byte version ... enjoy :)

Greets:

Rex DeathStar - check out his latest effort "firetiny.zip" 57 bytes (was 76)
the smallest fire effect i've seen.

Jare/Iguana - for starting this whole crazy fire thing years ago.

All you coders out there who've made a fire effect ... whether you admit
it or not! *8)





my thought for the day:
why is 'inc ax' one byte, while 'inc al' is two bytes? :)
