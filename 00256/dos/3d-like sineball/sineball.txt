 Couldn't fit antialiasing in 256 bytes (looks a lot nicer with). 
 The code could also be further size-optimized.                   

 Thanks/Greetings:

 Oh.. And in the spirit of the norwegian youth, I would like to   
 get some negative feedback about how much this sucked or why on  
 earth I made it. Thanks in advance.

 That's about it. Sorry for the bad grammar.
