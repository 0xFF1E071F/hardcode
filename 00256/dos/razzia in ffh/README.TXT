                  Razzia  in FFh   
              -===================-


 I   minimum Hardware:
 =====================-

 You need at least an AT286 with VGA,
 256 bytes of free memory and a
 DOS-compatible Operating System.

 Recommend is a Pentium-class-computer, which
 has enougth RAM for running the operating
 system in a good speed.

 II  known problems:
 ===================-

 If the computer is too lame, the screen moves wild;
 if it is too fast, you will propably don't see the intro.

 Under Windows you must run the intro in
 fullscreen (no DOS-Box), there will even
 any hardware-routines be ignored.
