My very first 256 bytes FX, that was fun!

- Simple ray vs plane algorithm
- Each pixel is raytraced, a lot of data could be precalculated
- The height of the plane is modulated on each pixel with the length of the vector from the eye to the plane
- The plane's texture is generated with the classical X xor Y pattern

The Slow FPU version features a X symetry, which involves no more X scolling
