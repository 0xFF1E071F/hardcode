>>>>> Hello, this is a Worm program which is only 189 bytes in size! <<<<<

In this game, 2 players can play, and each of them has 8 different
posibilities for motion and direction! (cool)

And if you're the type to play alone, then you have 16
motion controls at both of your hands... (left hand vr. right hand)

UP:             player1 = '8'           player2 = 'e'
DOWN:           player1 = '2'           player2 = 'c'
LEFT:           player1 = '4'           player2 = 's'
RIGHT:          player1 = '6'           player2 = 'f'
UP-LEFT:        player1 = '7'           player2 = 'w'
UP-RIGHT:       player1 = '9'           player2 = 'r'
DOWN-LEFT:      player1 = '1'           player2 = 'x'
DOWN-RIGHT:     player1 = '3'           player2 = 'v'

and 'q' to QUIT at any time. (don't quit, please...)

It actually took me 1 hour to write it! (hehehe)

bye!
