486 required to run this junk...

What I sort of tried to do in 256 bytes... Laugh out loud... 551 bytes!
Around 150 bytes of data!... well that can easily be reduced by means,
though once I hit the 500 byte mark I thought I might as well give up
anyway.

So I did. Nothing works so dont expect anything....

Should be possible to do it in a Bootro compo... hint, hint. 480 odd bytes
to play with. Cool-nostic.

Left/right: right <ALT> & <CTRL>,
fire:       left <SHIFT>
quit:       right <SHIFT>

No detection and no score.

bush.
