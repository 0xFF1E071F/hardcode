 "... instead of describing any definite structure of building, he
  dwells only on the broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--
  surfaces too great to belong to any thing right of proper for this earth,
  and impious with horrible images and heiroglyphs.  I mention his talk
  of /angles/ because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his
  awful dreams.  He had said that the /geometry/ of the dream-place he
  saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathesomely redolent of spheres
  and dimensions apart from ours..." - H.P. Lovecraft,
                                      _The_Call_of_Cthulhu_

Introduction
------------

R'lyeh is a strange and mystical journey through a phantasmal
dreamscape.  You are Mate Gustaf Johansen on his ultimate voyage to the
nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh, where lies great Cthulhu and his
hordes, separated from you, fortunately, by four high, impenetrable
walls.

R'lyeh joins the ranks of Castle Wolfenstein, DOOM, and other "virtual
reality" POV texture mapped ray casting 3D maze games, but without the
overhead of sloppy coding and wasteful graphics.  In fact, the code
itself comprises the texture map used for the walls.  You'd be able to
keep R'lyeh on your hard disk eternally and still have room for the
latest great games, lucky you.

Getting Around R'lyeh
---------------------

To move Mate Johansen around the game arena, use the righthand suite of
shift keys:

     <Alt>        Turn Mate Johansen counter-clockwise
     <Ctrl>       Turn Mate Johansen clockwise
     <RightShift> Move Mate Johansen forward
     <LeftShift>  Move Mate Johansen backward

In real life, there is no unsuffering escape from R'lyeh.  And even in
the game it ain't that pleasant.  To exit the game, press:

     <Ctrl><Alt><Delete>

Sorry about that folks...

Additional keys:

     <Space>      Open doors (there aren't any)
     <#>          Select weapon (you only have one)
     <Tab>        Fire weapon (no ammo)
     <S>          Toggle sound (but all is quiet)

Your Inventory
--------------

  "...they searched--vainly, as it proved--for some portable souvenier
   to bear away..."

The Object of the Game
----------------------

Like most any game, the real object is to have fun playing it.  To that
end, I think you'll find R'lyeh quite challenging.

Technical Info
--------------

The strange geometry of R'lyeh can be attributed to the lack of
trancendental functions on the trancendental plane.  And there are no
square roots in that demonic place.

Legal Info
----------

R'lyeh is Not-worth-mentioning-ware.  Therefore, you way freely
distribute it accross the map without restriction of any kind, without
any feeling of guilt, even without realizing you're doing it.
