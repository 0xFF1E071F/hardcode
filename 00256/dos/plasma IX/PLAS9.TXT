
        Hello, this is another entry for the Techstronics 256-byte
democompo. It's a kind of cross between a plasma and a fire. I made
twelve different versions of that idea. I took the one which I thought
is the best and I optimized it.

        Runs in non-standard VGA mode.. physically 320x400, logically
256x256, using a single buffer in conventional RAM, with split screen.
And actually, I'm faking 262144 colors, with R-G-B pixel triplets.

        386 VGA required... 486 recommended.. I developed this on a 486
DX 33 and the speed is ok.
