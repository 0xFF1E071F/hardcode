Blobby mass upon plasma. I had the idea to make sphere mapping upon plasma
by modifying my blob algorithm, but then something not intended happened 
and I had some glow blobs (Well,. not the right term but that's how I call
them, like a random pulsating light. Then, I decided to add it's colors
with the plasma to see what I get and it was something not intended.

I had the idea of the title siback long time ago, like "hello I am back and stuff"
It just came. And now, after a long time where I wanted to code again but I
only played Zdoom or studied, I got bored and said to myself "I want to do something
on my PC again". Even if it wasn't much work, rather than getting to effects and
connecting them together. But I just wanted to release something after long time
(I was thinking about a compo, but then I decided to release as it is).

And I do want to do something on my PC, but then again demoscene hit 2nd or 3rd priority.
Nobody knows if I will release something bigger inside 2005 now (I had plans for CPC unfinished
stuff, a new C64 demo and perhaps a secret project on PC). Too hard for me. But I will still be
there watching your stuff and perhaps getting inspired to be stuck in the demoscene again.. ;)

I really really don't know if my next release this year will be a bigger demo or another of those
tiny don't have anything else to do this night. Nothing is planned..

Expect anything.

Lately, demoscene.gr gets down, so I got a second webspace too. I didn't used Fortunecities because
they told me it tries to install some spyware. I think I will unsigned from there..
