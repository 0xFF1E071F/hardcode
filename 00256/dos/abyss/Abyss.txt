Abyss by DrKappa (15/04/2001)
===============================

History
========
This morning I was having a look at some old code of mine (things coded 4/5 years ago), and
I found an abandoned 256 byte project. This 256 byte intro should have been a simple mandelbrot
renderer and it was intended to take part of fidonet 256 byte intro compo. A couple of days
before the deadline, I found myself with a 311 bytes .com file, with no idea about how to
optimize it furtherly. The project was aborted and I decided to code another intro from scratch.
It was a mouse controlled bump mapping effect, and I was quite lucky because it took the first
place. :)
So, I decided to test my hardcoding attitude (if I ever had one.. :)) trying to complete the
unfinished 256-byte intro.
After a couple of hours I came out with a 164 byte renderer doing exactly the same things
the old 311 bytes .com file did. Then it was a simple refinement work (altough the intro
is quite rough) to add palette and zooming.

If you fuck yourself it is a your own problem, baby...

Tech stuff
===========
Abyss has been mainly coded and tested on a P166MMX, while refinement work has
been done using a 1.2Ghz Athlon.
It runs fine in plain DOS and win95/98/2k.

Hardcoding notes
=================
In order to follow the original idea, this renderer has been coded using standard 80386/80387
instructions. The fractal is calculated using only FPU. Surely a fixed-point approach would
have been faster on older machines and could allow a shorter intro.
Video mode is a standard 13h, and the rendering area is 256x100. Colors used for rendering
are 96/64 (64 effective colors, but up to 96 interations per pixel).
On older machines Abyss doesn't run well. To use only 32/16 colors provides a big
speedup, but the resulting effect sux.
