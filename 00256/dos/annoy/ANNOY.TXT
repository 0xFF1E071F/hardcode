A N N O Y

This program is called annoy.  I hope the colors burn your eyes out.
Written quickly, it's really a piece of shit :-)  Run in full screen
DOS BOX because it does some text display shit at the end and like,
if you have not made the DOS Box full screen you'll miss it since
when windows gets out of GFX mode it puts it back into a box and it's
updating of that window is slow.

The Demo Ends on it's own, so don't be hitting keys you'll only fuck
yourself.

Anyway, Long Live Etch-
