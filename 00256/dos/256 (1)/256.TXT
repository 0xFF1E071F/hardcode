 This is just a simple 256-bytes intro, made by Spyko 
in 1996. I suppose you can code it even smaller, but I 
did it only for fun and therefore didn't bother about 
that last optimizing. On some computers their is a bug 
which makes the screen flicker heavily, but who cares?
I included the source so that you can do what you want 
with it, but as usual: DONT claim that you are the author
of it  (it is anyway not very much to be the author of)!

PS:   I lied, the intro is only 255 bytes
