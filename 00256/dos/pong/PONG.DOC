Well, seeing as I only had 256 bytes, I had to keep it pretty simple.
You have a paddle.  A ball bounces around, and you have to keep it on the
left side of the screen.  If it does happen to get by you, it will reset
to the left side of the screen, and you can keep playing!  That's JUST HOW
MUCH FUN IT IS!  You can even try to have longer runs than your friends, but
that'd be pretty pathetic. :)

NEW! In version 1.1, you can now keep score!  Whenever the ball bounces off
your paddle, it will change color.  If you miss, it will go back to it's
starting color of blue.  So you can keep track of your highest color ever,
and if you're really good, you can get it to wrap back around to blue!!

If you want to contact me (if you're interested in the source, I suppose
I'd be willing to part with it), go ahead and email me at:
