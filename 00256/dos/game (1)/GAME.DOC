
        Well, here it is! This is my fabulous entry into the <= 256 byte
game contest! It's 226 bytes to be exact. I could have made it even a bit
smaller, but I wanted to add a few frills like background color. (Without
the background color stuff, it's 187 bytes ;). This one'll bring back some
memories for those old enough to remember this kind of thing.

        Keys are left and right arrows, and any other key quits the game.

        I had fun coding this, so if you have any more of these contests, 
be sure and mail me to let me know.
