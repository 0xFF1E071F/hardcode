   This is a tube27^byteway contribution to Xenium 256 intro compo.


   What the f... is that ?

   Eh , this 8 crappy 256 intros are in fact a preview part of our
   unfinished intro collection (unnamed). Of course collection
   will consist of a 'lil bit more than 1000b pieces of code.
   Yet there're about 14 intros and we're still working on some next.
   We have no idea when the collection will be released. You can
   check how our work goes by mailing or sth.

   It should run on every pc. No 3dfx , no sound , no MMX.
   But it definately SHOULDN'T be run under windoze !!!!!
   hicolor part needs gfx card that can support 320x400 mode.
  
   If any problems , just reboot your maschine and try on
   clean system. It always helps.
