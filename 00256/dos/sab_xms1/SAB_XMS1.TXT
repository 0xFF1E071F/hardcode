Here's my 1st entry to the 256-byte compo: sab_xms1. Original name, no?
Well I can't help it, coz I had barely little time to code, so I also didn't 
have time to think of a name :(. I wish I had seen this before, so next time
I'll probably have something better (if I find the time then ;).

Hopy you enjoy it, especially reading the source, I hope you get it.
I even documented it :).

Signing off,
