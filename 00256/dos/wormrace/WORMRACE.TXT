Wormrace... my entry in the 256 byte game compo.
--------

Pretty simple really.  The idea came from a game that I used to play
on the Commodore Pet called DRIVER.  Ah, the fond memories.  Basically
just try to stay alive (inside the track, silly) as long as you can.  If
you really want to get competetive, I suppose you could play with a stop-
watch to see how long you last.  You get faster and faster (really a 
nervous worm, you are) until you crash or you win (well, you really can't
win, but you're a dumb worm and you don't know that).

Controls:
  4 (on the numeric keypad) - go left
  6 (on the numeric keypad) - go right
  ESC                       - quit

Have fun (I hope)!

bugs and features -
  o  386 specific... sorry, but I needed to use the extended registers
  ÿ  for increasing the delay... probably could have done it another
     way, but nothing came to me :)
  o  if you go outside the bounds of the racetrack, you can just sit
     there until the delay wraps around... then you'll have to reboot
     or wait a long long time.
  o  there's no way to actually win - i wanted to put some sort of
     scorekeeping in, but that didn't happen. oh well.
  o  just do a cls when the game ends.  You often can't see the prompt
     'cause the colors are all weird.  It didn't crash.  You are in DOS.
     Remain calm.  Clear the screen.
