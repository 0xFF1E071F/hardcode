    Weird Magic Brings ya....256 bytes (or less) of pure fire imagination...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Code : GB
 For  : Internet 256 byte fire compo

 Ok...it's not so great...but hey It was my first fire attempt and it had to fit
 in 256 bytes too... Sure I've got more ideas..like text and some funny
 things with dots...but than again....It's only 256 bytes or less..:)
 Well the fire algo thingy is that simple I ain't gonna explain it....

 Some info about the palette setting might be usefull..
 It's all in the precalculated 8.8 fixpoint step values...
 like this db 64,8,128,34,64,-55 means that red green or blue is set up by
 starting at zero and then in 64 steps increased with fixstep 8 after that
 128 steps increased with fixstep 34 and last 64 steps increased with fixstep
 -55.. well euh...sometin like that....Well palette setting could be a lot
 smaller but than you would loose the benefit of setting much more different
 types of colors...As you can see you have to read the source to understand it
 since I can't explain it well....:)..(A bad habit :( )
 That the colors aren't the standard fire ones is totaly my resposability....
 I detest fire colors...they are so 'yuck'! I prefer blue-green and green-blue
 stuff...

 Only thing to put in the 60 bytes left is that random (random !?)
 vertical star (dot, piece of burning paper)...well it sure isn't a great idea
 and I'm sorry for that...but hey, That stupid Gaffer came up with those
 nasty 256 bytes...:) Still 16 bytes left but my inspiration was gone

 Ok all is left are some words and words are words when they can be read and
 written..bla bla har har...(shoot me !)...

 This may be put on a CDRom !!!! ;))) Just gimme 25% of da revenues....
 euh...sure !!!! ;) Like hell they will !!!

 Extremly inspired by listening some fsol cd's ;) (barf..suck it) (music is
 magnificent though)

 Well some words fly to...:
 - all Weird Magicians (Hey...komt dur nog wat van..euh..ik met mijn grote bek!)
 - Distance / Orange (You are the coolest guy to chat with ;) Honest!)
