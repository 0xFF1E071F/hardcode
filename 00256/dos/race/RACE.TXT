				RACE

Game Play:

        You're driving a red sports car (use your imagination!) down
        a winding, country road.  Occasionally, rocks appear in the
        road.  The blue ones are bonus rocks.  They make the road wider
	by one character, but never wider than the original maximum
	road width.  They also increase the score by one.  (Score explained
	later.)  The brownish-red rocks also increase the score, but
	BEWARE!  They decrease the maximum size of the road, increasing
	the difficulty.

How the score works:

	The score is continually displayed in the lower right corner of the
	screen.  It really is a hexadecimal code, but it maps to the letters
	A-P instead of 0-9,A-F.  Enough said.
