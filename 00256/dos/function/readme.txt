"Function" / HellMood & Rudi / 256b

256byte MSDOS - Demo for Function 2014

Please run with DOSBOX 0.74!

Please use "cycles=max" in the config.

This demo plays sound via MIDI.

This demo quits on any key.

This demo starts with a "pause"
with a black screen, you only hear
a pad sound. This is intended!
Please do not interrupt ;)

My original "dosbox-0.74.conf"
is appended for convenience.

The intended effect is, the name
"Function" spelled, letter by letter
and faded away into some travelling
wavefront particles, while a chill
house beat is running. If anything
runs not as described here, mail me:
