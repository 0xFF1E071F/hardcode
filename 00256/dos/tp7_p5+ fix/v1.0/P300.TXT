
TP7/P5+ fix, v1.0 freeware

This is a fix for programs compiled with Turbo/Borland Pascal 7.0
which give a 'run time error 200 at xxxx:xxxx' message on faster
pentium and all pentium 2 processors. 

It's a TSR - it doesn't make any changes in your .EXE files!
Instead, you have to start it every time you start you computer.
This gives you a chance to run old good Pascal programs without
recompiling! (for an example of old good Pascal programs go to:
http://rainbow.mimuw.edu.pl/~maf/stuff.html  - my demos/intros :)

This program may be freely distributed without prior permission.
I do not take any responsibilities for damages caused by it.
