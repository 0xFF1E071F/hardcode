You are a little space ship that unluckily has to defend
earth from a lot of stupid little aliens. You have this
teleportable missile that you may fire whenever you like,
at the aliens.
Since the missile can be only at one position, you will
notice it disappear from it's original position to your
new firing position as if by magic! (Um, ok lousy explantion).
The aliens seem to have forgotten their ammo, no wait...
You have jammed their weopons system (Yes that's better)
With the newest technology... Um... Well... that's it!

- You have to extremely stupid to lose the game!
- The game is unoptimized and stupid, hell, I forgot my OWN deadline *sigh*
  This is just the prototype I wrote to see if it was at all possible!
