Subject: 256 bytes game compo !


  Steve !

Let me introduce the new amazing 256 bytes game ! 

Few words about limitations:
 
 - 256 bytes of memory.
 - No sound support. 
 - First game without 'game over' routine.
 - First game without points counter
   (game over and score takes about 20 bytes !) .

Goals:
   Using your 'spaceship' you must deflect bullet ( nice raytraced, 
    isn't it ?) and hit all the 'bricks' !

Controls:

   Left and right arrow moves 'spaceship' left and right. 
   Esc - quit the game.

Notes: 
   Too fast (realtime !) - try to switch turbo off.
   Keyboard rate should be set to max, and delay to min !
   Bullet is deflected with same angle but don't think that's
   easy to hit all bricks. 
   I've changed horizontal blanking and size of line , so right edge
   of screen is shifted to the left.
