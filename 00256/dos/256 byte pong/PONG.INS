1.0     Instructions for play

        LEFT-SHIFT moves paddle left
        RIGHT-SHIFT moves paddle right
        CTRL quits

        Object is to keep the yellow ball in play.

        Simple eh? What do you expect for 256 bytes?


2.0     Some notes

        This is my humble entry for the 256-bytes or less contests. It is
exactly 256 bytes long and written in 100% assembly language using TASM v3.0.
Basically, I used a previous pong program of mine which was originally more
than 600 bytes and shaved off all the bells and whistles. Took me around 4
hours to do this, not including time spent writing the original code.

        Well, I don't really expect to win the dream prize of $5, but it was
really fun writing this, and I picked up a thing or two along the way. Enjoy!
