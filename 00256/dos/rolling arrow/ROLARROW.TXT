Requirements
------------

   - IMB PC compatible computer
   - VGA display adapter
   - 386+ processor (coded with 386DX25/nocache)
   - MS-DOS
   - 64+ Kb of free lower memory
   

Short Technical Description
---------------------------

   The fire effect itself is a modified old:
   
      color[x][y] = (color[x][y] +
                     color[x-1][y+1] +
                     color[x][y+1] +
                     color[x+1][y+1]) / 4
                     
   There are two modifications:
   
      - Random +-1 change to X-coordinate when calculating new color
      - Value N is subtracted from new color to make flames smaller
        (N is 4 for this executable), underflow is taken care of
        
   This means that we need one relatively "random" bit to update each
   pixel in the buffer. To make this fast and with minimum number of
   bytes, I used the executable code itself as a "random" value
   string.

   The background picture which is "in fire", is updated for each
   frame and it presents a rolling upwards pointing arrow. The arrow
   was probably one of the easiest figures that could be drawn in the
   buffer. Width of each line of the arrow is scaled using scaling
   values 0-1 to make it "roll". Scaling value changes linearly, not
   according to sin-function because I run out of bytes.
   
   Palette is constructed using colors:
   
      0 - 31         black -> red
      32 - 63        red -> yellow
      
   I also used memory buffer to calculate updates and just copied it
   to the video memory. I could have made the effect much smaller if I
   had used only video memory but it didn't look good on slow machines
   (like my 386).

   There you go... Source code includes some comments too.
