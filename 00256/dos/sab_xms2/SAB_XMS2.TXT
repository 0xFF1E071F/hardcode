Here's my 2nd entry to the 256-byte compo: sab_xms2. Again not an original 
name, I know, but I had little time. I didn't even document it :(. I had so
little time, I had to stop coding at 112 bytes, I could have crammed a litte
more effects in, but I'm sleepy and I have something to do tomorrow.. eehm
today... Hmm.. yeah.. well... enjoy or something :).

Signing off,
