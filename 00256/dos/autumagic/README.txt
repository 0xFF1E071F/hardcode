      "autuMagic" - by HellMood/DESiRE
          256 bytes demo for DOS
 released 09/2015 at "Function" demoparty

*******************************************

Hello there! =)


this demo shows 65536 animated fractal particles
at a resolution of 1024x768 pixels (VESA Mode 0x105)

to achieve reasonable speed, the demo switches to
protected mode and accesses the graphic memory
directly with 32bit code.

there's no way of "ESC"aping, i'm sorry ;) there
was simply no way of squeezing the "return to real
mode" into the demo. please restart the computer after
a minute or if it get's too boring

if possible, please put the following text into the
announcing slide :
------------------------------------------------
Who said smooth fractal animations in 1024x768 cannot 
be done in 256 bytes? Certainly not me ;)
------------------------------------------------

i am providing the demo in three resolutions. please
stick to the highest, and only downgrade if your beamer
does not support the resolution or the demo won't run.

"AUTU768P.com"  -> 1024x768 pixels (DEFAULT!)
"autu600p.com"  ->  800x600 pixels
"autu480p.com"  ->  640x480 pixels

i am also providing two proof of concept videos,
showing the execution on two different systems
both booted to "FreeDos, FreeCom 0.84-pre2"

1) Nvidia GeForceG105M, Intel Core2 Duo T6500
WATCH : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc5tlAFBiwA

if the demo totally refuses to run on your system(s)
and you believe in the proof of concept videos
you might want to show an emergency video

anotherway differing from the provided videos, please don't
show it.
