    A 256 byte intro for New School Combined Intro category at Sundown 2016
       100% party coding - finished less than 10 minutes before deadline
  VGA and 387+ (just for FSINCOS) required, but it's better on faster machines

             DOSBox with machine=vgaonly and cycles=max works fine
        Inspired by the voxel landscape section in Arsantica 3 by DESiRE
                              More NFO coming soon
