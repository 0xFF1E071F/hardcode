Story
-----
   There are some aliens living on Mars and nobody ever discover them.
They looked like crabs and they walk like crabs too ( horizontal ).
   One day they decided to invade earth, because all earth's citizen had
goto vacation on moon and other planets except you. You are alone on
earth now, playing computer game call Space Invader VIII. Then suddenly
you saw a lot of aliens on the sky flying horizontally surrounding earth
while trying to land on earth. Fortunately they forgot to bring weapons
because of their stupid commander thought that there is nobody on earth.
So you quickly jump into your jet and ......

How to Play
-----------

The enemies is moving from west to east (left to right) sorrounding the earth
when they reappear on west (left) they are 500km (1 line) nearer. You will
have to kill them all before they kill you, although they don't have weapons
they still can kill you by knocking you down when they get near you. They
will get more angry each time you kill their friends so they will move faster
and faster. You can only move like them,if want to move nearer to the enemies
then you move left or you want to get away then move right. You will crush
on earth if you keep on moving to the right, because your jet cann't fly
under ground. Some stronger enemies have more than one hitspoint, so you
have to shoot them a few times. When you are chasing by the enemies and
if you think you have courage then move toward them and if you are lucky
enough you may survive.
