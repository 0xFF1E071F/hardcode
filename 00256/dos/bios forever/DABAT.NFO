Instructions:

The demo will run under any OS able to run dos-apps, but please use pure 
dos when you judge it. Preferable an old bootdisc with DOS 5.0 or something, 
but that is optional =)
If for some unknown reason you don't want to watch it anymore, just press a                                                                      
key. You also have to restore the video to be able to see anything. 
"mode co80" works fine.
                                                                     
                                                                     /DA·AT
