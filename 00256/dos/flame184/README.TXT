FLAME - a 184 byte flame effect by Gaffer/PRoMETHEUS '96
--------------------------------------------------------

I originally coded this as an entry for the #coders 256 byte fire compo,
but i figured that i probably shouldnt enter it since i was counting
the votes :)  ... i also ran outta space for entries in the vote
program *8)

<blatant plug>
Check out the 256 byte fire compo results ;)

anyway, i was bored the other day, so i started tinkering with
my fire effect, after a few days of tweaking i'd reduced it down
from 256 bytes to 184 bytes - yeah yeah :)

no luck going any lower today, so i figured i'd leave it for a
while. if you reckon you can squeeze a few more bytes outta it
go for it... just email me! :)

greets to Rex Deathstar, the dude who did "tinifire" ... good stuff ;)
dont think i can make 76 bytes with this one though, i want to
keep it looking good! :)

later!
