;
; ABOUT THE GAME
; The computer chooses a six digit decimal number who's digits are
; all different, and the player needs to make guesses (in a sane
; manner of course...), to which the program responses with a pair
; of numbers: the number of digits of the guess that matched the
; chosen number including correct placing, and the number of digits
; that are present in both the guess and the chosen number, but
; do not match in place. The game ends when the player has solved
; the combination or after 20 wrong guesses are made.
;
; USAGE
; Type 6 decimal digits and press enter. (Edit according to your shell.)
; Entering a null string exits the game.
;
; HINTS
; Try 111222, 333444, ... first, then try to narrow position ranges.
; Combine multiple questions into less guesses.
;
; INSPIRATION
; My (rather old) mobile had this game, but my friend with a different
; revision of the same mobile missed this feature. So, he asked me if
; I could make a game like this for a PC. Naturally I answered yes ;-)
