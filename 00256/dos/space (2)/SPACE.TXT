                          The Space text file.

      Coded by the Immaculate - a demo group.
                                 
      Requirements : 386, VGA, keyboard
      Recommended  : PC speaker 
                                
      List of features.
      
      1. Uses real colored sprites in graphics mode (mode 13h)
      2. Aliens should move pretty much like the good ol' one 
      3. Sound Effects!
         When you manage to shoot one of the bad guys you will hear an
         explosion (well, actually it's more like a 'beeeep' - but hey, use
         your imagination!)
      4. Precise collision detection - this makes the game real hard to beat,
         so there should be enough challenge in this game for some time. It'll
         definitely be while before you shoot down all aliens, because you
         have to very precise to hit those suckers.
      5. Play the game or see the source for the rest of the features.                                                        
                                                   
      Controls :                                   
                                                   
      left  : ','  (next to 'm')
      right : '.'           
      shoot : space         
      quit  : escape       
                           
      It's preferable to play under Dos, but it works fine under Win95.
      
      Enjoy the game!
