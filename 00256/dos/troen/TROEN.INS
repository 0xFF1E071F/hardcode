Hi!
Here's my contribution for the contest. It's a kind of nibbles game without
coming tales for two players. You might also say it's based on the cycles
scene in the film Tron (of which there was a game called Tron on the BBC B
years ago). To avoid conflicts and copyright agreement I don't call it Tron,
but Troen (which I believe is not a copyrighted name (as it's my last
name)).

The game is extremly simple, and there is no highscore tables, sound or
anything like that. Player 1 controls with left and right arrow keys, and
player 2 controls with 'a' and 'd'.

The .com file is 255 bytes long. It's tested on a 486 dx-40 (cyrix), with
MSDOS 6.22, but should be able run on all 80x86 compatible machines with a
vga compatible graphics card.
