.dSK! info
   dSK! is a Spanish demoScene Krew. This is our first production.
   dSK! was created at the end of 1996... but it has been inactive until
    now.
   dSK! is closely related to Mystic Bytes (game producers).
   dSK! world headquarters (JamQue's house ;) is in Barcelona (SPAIN).
   dSK! has as primary objective our own enjoyment.
    Is it clear?
