phonq tunnel - whizzter/woorlic  - 1999

hoho.. i just optimized this code in my head while writing it,
NO opts after the code was working...  cool uh? ;)
if you land at 255 bytes when ready then i think it's cool,
talk about optimizing mind if you get to this size directly. :)

well it's a tunnel with a bit of twisting.. looks damn neat imho.
i had done some nearly alike C code some week before i wrote
this to test a little gfxlib i made for linux and dos.
