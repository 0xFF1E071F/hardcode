256 Byte Scramble


This program was written as a bit of fun. During 1995,
 one of the programming newsgroups on the Internet had
 a competition to write games in 256 bytes or less!
 This was my entry, Scramble. The goal is basically to
 stay alive for as long as possible, without colliding
 into the caverns or crashing into one of the air-mines
 that are placed randomly in your path.

Usage: SCRAMBLE
Keys: Left Shift = Up, Control = Down
The game exits when you crash your spaceship into a
 cavern or air-mine.

Of course, the usual disclaimers apply. If this program
 (albeit extremely unlikely) wipes your hard drive clean,
 makes your PC crash, brings you bad fortune, makes your
 hair drop out, turns your milk sour, invites your
 parents in-law round for dinner, etc, I'm not
 responsible!
