about:
matrix was just a test project,
which turned out... ok I think.
I was experimenting with using
two buffers. I made a palette
changer/rotator. I also made a
softener. Heh.. This turned out
ok. wooha! The palette changer
is a bit buggy. But.. it works
nice enough. I was pretty tired,
so I'm not sure if everything
made sense, heh.
