|...my first try with text. Loops after          |
|displaying 4 different texts and lissajous.     |
|Edit text yourself, would have made a nice      |
|Invitro ;-)                                     |
|                                                |
|- Should run on DOSBox (60000 cycles), FreeDOS  |
|  and command line on Win XP                    |
|- Assembles with Flat Assembler                 |      
|                                                | 
|Extra:                                          |  
|                                                |
|In the extra folder you will find a version     |
|without the lissajou effect, but some housy     |
|general midi sound. Due to the rules at         |
|Function (no sound is played) I had to skip     |
|this version, but before it dies on my          |
|harddrive I'll share it also, as it's my        |
|first experiment with sound. Of course this     |
|extra didn't take part in the competition.      |
|                                                |
|Cheers,                                         |
|                                                |
|     Kuemmel                                    |
|                                                |
| *shortcut in swabian german dialect for        |
|  "Alte Schule", translates to oldschool ;-)    |
|                                                |
