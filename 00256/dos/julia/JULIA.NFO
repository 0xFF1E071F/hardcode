processor       : 386+387 or better (p200 recommended)
memory          : 128k conventional
video           : standard vga (color monitor recommended)

.troubleshooting

check if  you have  at  least a  386 processor,  a  math coprocessor  and  vga
adapter. if you have all of these and the intro still doesn't work, delete  it
or write me.

.comments

yes, we  know, this  is a  really old  effect, but  some people  said that  we
should release it, so  we did. Btw it  wasn't easy to fit  it in 256  bytes...
