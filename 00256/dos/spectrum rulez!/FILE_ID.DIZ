Spectrum rulez! [BUGFIXED]
256b PC DOS intro by TomCat/Abaddon
entry for the Chaos Constructions 2016 demo party

Two water filled spheres front of the Spectrum rainbow.

Oh my favorite micro computer was the Speccy,
and my favorite Spectrum game was the Chaos :)

Good old days... my nickname comes from our Spectrum group
called The Cat (Tomi of The Cat)

We did some ZX demos: MusicDemo, MegaDemo...
and The game: Defender of the Crown !
