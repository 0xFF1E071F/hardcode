  In 2o48 The Black Knight Satellite suddenly disappeared.
  Only a few hours later an  unknown object was discovered
                - in the orbit of the moon

   Up to this day no one knows where The Black Knight Orb
    comes from. Also the reason of its existence remains
    unknown.  Several conspirary theories state that its
   origin lies somewhere on the "dark  side" of aldebaran
    and it is here to announce the upcoming arrival of a
                higher nameless existence.

        They call the orb  "The Eye Of Aldebaran".

                It is the 3rd May of 21o7.
   I woke up and there is a strange  feeling to this day.
