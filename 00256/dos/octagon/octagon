Subject: Entry, 256-byte game contest


Ok, this is my entry to 256-byte game contest.

It runs in VGA or MCGA mode 13h. Although this was not specified in the
rules it is a standalone program, that does not use qbasic or the like.

Both a standard and an easy version are uuencoded inside this doc.

    Requirements:

        512 bytes free dos mem (due to the PSP).
            If you do not have 512 bytes free dos mem, a boot disk can
            be appointed for you. You might also consider beefing up
            your system with a K or two.
        386 or better.
            Pentium-90 strongly recommended. It will make absoluty no
            difference for this game, but it's a nice machine to have
            around, so we recommend it anyway.

    Story:

        The object of the game is to keep the multicolored strange
        alien life form (or line if you want to be that way) safely
        within the octagonal containment grid. Due to cut's in government
        funding your outfit can only afford to run the containment
        system at 1/8 the power it was designed for. But hey, thats ok
        as long as it is the right 1/8 - thats where you come in...
        The tremendous cost overrun resulting from your overtime has
        been approved - this also happens to be your chance to save
        the galaxy (ever had one of those before?).

    How to play:

        Press any key to start the game.

        You control the reflector grid with the numeric keypad (Num Lock
        should be on or you will have a short game).

        When you fail to contain the ray, the game ends. You can restart
        it by pressing any key.

        To exit the game press Q *during* play.
        (Actually you can press any key > '9', but Q sounds as if I planned
        it that way)

    Apology:

        So where did the score go, why doesn't the game get more difficult,
        where is my 1024x768 Cindy Crawford background?

        Well... er... 256 bytes isn't all that much ya know.

        I did get room for linedrawing, collision detect, random, octagon
        coordinates, vsync synchronization, keyboard control etc.
        - so stop whining!

    Warranty:

        I hereby guarantee that this is a program. Nothing else may be
        implied including any conjecture from the above text. When you
        run this program you are on your own - if any problems result
        they are your problems - not mine.


BTW, I believe someone should award you a prize, Steve. It was great fun
cooking up (down?) this thing - this is the sort of thing convinces me
I was right to give up management in favor of coding.

P.S.
In case anybody thinks I am violating a software patent with this game,
please sue me. I published a full version of it in 1981 - if you made a
bestselling hit on the concept I will look forward to hearing from you.
