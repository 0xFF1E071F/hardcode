Here it is! Oh yes! Just what we've all been waiting for!
Just look at these features:
        -FLICKER-FREE 256-color graphics!
        -SMOOTH 2-way paddle motion!
        -AMAZING FOUR-WAY ball motion!
        -INCREDIBLY easy to learn!

Easy-to-follow directions:
1. Run the program. Type PONG <ENTER>.
2. Left player uses CAPS Lock to go up, CTRL to go down.
3. Right player uses Right Shift to go up, Alt to go down.
4. -OR- Your right hand can play against your left hand.
5. DON'T press any other keys! It won't crash the computer,
   but it might make the paddles go weird.
6. The program will end when one of the players loses. When
   it exits, your CAPS, SCR LCK, and NUM LCK lights might
   not be the same as they were before. Tough. You're lucky
   I put you back in text mode.
7. Send me money.
