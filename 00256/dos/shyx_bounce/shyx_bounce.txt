        ==== Bouncing ball in 256 bytes, by shyx ====

Hello, every one!

This is the first 256 byte demo I write myself. Hope you like it.
It runs quite well on my Celeron 400MHz, but it will be a bit too
fast on some new PCs.

It draws a ball bouncing on a horizontal plane. The soft shadow of
the ball should look quite nice. 320x200 mode might be a bit ugly,
since the ball looks elliptical. Also I have run out of bytes to 
terminate the program, so you had better run it under Windows, and 
close the window after you have had enough.
