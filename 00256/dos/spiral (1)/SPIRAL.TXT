Another stupid pattern thingy based on my dopey Sierpins sort of random number
generated gasket. May need to up the "Number_1 EQU..." and will look nice
especially on a pentium 200 or greater. (Works fine as it is on my old '166).


The beginning text screen scroll/dropper was first seen on a VZ computer
back in 1986. Forget who originally wrote it... was in Z80 assembler... maybe
in about 40 bytes. Was then seen by me on a RAZOR 1911 demo back in '92(?)
and I tried to base a design on it. Took me a dang long time to work out how
to do it. Started off with a working asm program of about 350 bytes!
Finally after many hours (days (months [written: 2 years!])) got it down to
the current 51 bytes. A far cry from the first asm version that I had.
