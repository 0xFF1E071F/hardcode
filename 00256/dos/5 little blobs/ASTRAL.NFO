 T once upon time there was a group called unicorn. there  were  a  lot  of :
 : problems with it, and we decided to create a new  team. on  the 19th  of .
 . december 1997 astral was born. the founders were: towerx, robson, magic,
   n0thingman (his name used to be sherlock, but he changed it)  after  the
   jumper party in 1997, ren joined our team (just 4  fun:). sprite  joined
   as a tracer in january. before the flag'98 party, we met icicle. he  was
   our musician but he was kicked out, because  he  wasn't  too active.  in
   the near future we want to release a musicdisc. the musics and the  main
   code are ready. our demo was released at the  scenest-rage  party. after
   two month of convincing finally shaman decided joining astral. edo  left
   contract and became a member of astral. strepto (was a coder of  an  old
   team) started his scene-life again  and  became  an  astraler :)  before
   antiq '98 and arpi joined at the party as a coder. ren leaved  our team,
   because he thought  that  scene  is  a  boring  thing. immortal  rat  in
   november decided to continue his great scene  activity  with  us.  magic
   was kicked out in november, because he was totally inactive. the silence
   has broken up around astral and begun to work on the second demo  called
   "friday". this demo will be finished  around  april  or may.  n0thingman
   (sherlock) and robson decided to make a  site  for  trackers  and  music
   stuff, called "trackrsite". the site is really  under  construction  but
   you don't  have to wait for a long time because it will be  finished  in
   the near future ( hopfully....:). the www address:
          http://astral.scene-hu.com/trackrsite or you can reach our
   ftp://sherlock.sch.bme.hu. sherlock had to leave  the  university so  if
   you have an account where we can place around 800megz of  music (all  of
   them created with different trackers) catch me  at robson@astral.org  an
   there are some more  members  now  again: beef (who is a  tracer  and  a
   keyframer) and phuture kemist (as a musician)...ohh..our group seems  to
   be very large nowdays :))
