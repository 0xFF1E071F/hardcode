    Local Bus VGA video card


°°° ABOUT
°°°°±±±±±²²²²

This little fire demo was produced for the #coders 256 byte fire compo.
It was created in a hurry after I saw Gaffer was running this compo through
the csipd newsgroup. Several of my old routines were thrown together, tidied
up and optimized (*cough* *cough*), to form what you see in this package.
No doubt you will have seen these little tricks before in about 1000 other
demos, but hey - I like the idea of cramming as many effects as I can into
256 bytes.
Feel free to _borrow_ my ideas and code for this thing, but just remember to
mention me in any credits or greetings for the production you use my stuff in.
This demo is the first release from tektonic and look out for more stuff in
the future - when I get around to coding more!

Hmmmm.... tektonic seems to be lacking a few members.
Maybe YOU can do something about that. I'm looking for _Australian_ coders,
musicians, and gfx artists who know what they are doing, and are willing to
be a part of tektonic so we can be a greater part of the Australian demo
scene. If you think you've got what it takes, send me an email and we'll
discuss you becoming a part of the group.
BTW: Bonus pts if you live in South Australia!

°°° FUTURE PLANS
°°°°°°±±±±±±²²²²²

All of the stuff I have planned revolves around protected mode coding in asm.
I use DOS32 by Adam Seychell, since it seems to be one of the best dos-
extenders around and is very easy to use.
Things that are currently well under development include a protected mode mod
player, a 3d-engine with full lightsource shading and texture mapping, and a
few others which I won't mention until they are ready to release.
