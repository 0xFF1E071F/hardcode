Premise:
--------
    Hello gamer, welcome to Kitty of Death.  Kitty of Death is a furious 
kitty chase game with remote control missiles.  However it takes less than
or equal to 256 bytes of hard drive space!  Enjoy!!!!! 

Story:
------
    Evil Kitty has been eating your shrubs for a very long time.  You're 
_really_ piqued off about this and decide to kick his ass once and for all. 
However, you are no match for Evil Kitty in hand to hand combat, so you 
decide to take him down with a handy dandy remote control missile.    
But be careful you don't blow yourself up! 

Object:
_______
    The object of the game is to hit kitty 9 times (he has 9 lives) with 
your remote control missile.  

*You are the orange ê.  
  -you can run:
    up    (8 on numeric keypad)
    down  (2 on numeric keypad)  
    left  (4 on numeric keypad)  
    right (6 on numeric keypad)
  -you can hold the key down for maximum speed.  Keys are immediate response.
  -note you can wrap around the left and right, and the top and the 
     bottom of the screen (good to fake out kitty)
  -also note that you can use the arrow keys also, but they can cause your 
     guy to stall a bit  (screwy scan code stuff) 
   
*Kitty is the green ã.  
  -Kitty likes to chase you. If he catches you "Game Over, Man!!",  he's 
     fast and likes to kick your ass so watch out!!! 

*Your remote control missile is the yellow þ.  
  -Your missile always follows your running direction unless either you 
     are stopped, or it has bounced off a shrub.
  -If the missile hits kitty, he loses a life.  When he has lost 9 lives you 
     have won the game and have saved your shrubbery!!!  Yay!
  -If the missile hits you, you are dead. (humans only have one life :^) )

*Gray ± are shrubs
  -Kitty can eat your shrubs to pass through them.   
  -You can not pass through the shrubs. 
  -Your missle bounces off of the shrubs.

*The cyan number in the upper left corner is kittys lives left.
  -Kitty starts with 9 lives.
  -Kitty loses a life everytime you hit him with a missile.
  -Once this number hits 0 you have won the game.

*When the game ends, 
  -The number in the upper left hand corner is your score, 9 being the 
        worst and 0 meaning you have won the game!!

Additional Hints:
-----------------
  -Immediately when the game starts find your guy quickly and move up 
     or down to wrap around the screen to stall kitty.
  -Hold the keys down for maximum speed!  
  -Kitty isn't terribly smart, keep going up and down, wrapping around the       
     top and bottom of the screen, to keep kitty in the same column. 
  -Gradually move your missle over to that column, and then zonk him!   
  -If kitty is really hot on your trail going from left or right, moving 
     up or down a block can get him to reverse direction!
  -This game is _really_ hard, although with enough practice, you can beat 
     it _almost_ every time.  At least I can!.  ;^)

Enough chit-chat,  GO WASTE KITTY!!!!!
