        My demo is 255 bytes, just to be different! Also, after finishing it I
managed to get it even smaller - but not small enough for a changing message
(well I couldn't be bothered!) Anyway to take up a little space I thought I'd
make it look nice when you do a DOS [type JDXMAS97.COM] - had to get my handle
in there somewhere... ;) Ooh, look! - even the entry form is 255 bytes, I
*need* to get a life..

                             -= JaKDaW =-

PS - If someone called Trojan appears on #coders please msg me and remind me
to set my nick to JaKDaW... damn shared machines !! M@cs ;( Ah well... free
net connection!

You want source??? Ask nicely...
