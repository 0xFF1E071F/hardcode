    the andromeda galaxy is an enourmous astral body with billions of stars.
    it's  been rotating constantly since the big-bang,  and will most likely
    remain so for  a few more millenniums.  but when  the day comes, it will
    start to shrink  and eventuelly  turn into  one single  piece of matter,
    though you and i will be long gone,but right now you can watch this take
    place, right here on you computer.

    the demo  requires  a 386 processor  to run,  due to  the use of  32-bit
    instructions.  but please run it on something faster,  like a p100+,  or
    any other fast machine. also make sure you have about 400kb of free mem.

    turn out to be harmfull in any way;  neon  wont take any responsibility.
