256b intro
for WeCan 2012 (256b Intro)
by fsqrt

code / frag

Simple and fast-coded intro, ~7h from scratch, far from optimal.

System requirements:
Fast FPU, Windows XP or pure DOS or DOSBox (much slower).
In case of DOSBox make sure that core=dynamic in .conf file.
Runs infinitely, press esc to exit.

Greetings to all sizecoders!
