INTRODUCTION

        This is a game for two players. You play the roles of Bongo and
        Murlock, two rivalling gang members. Both have the same interest:
        Cars, Sports and Wendy. Wendy is your average blonde bimbo, who
        only likes men who likes (you guessed it) Cars, Sports and Wendy.
        Since both Bongo and Murlock are rather egoistic, they of course
        want Wendy for themselves. They have decided to settle this matter
        once and for all, with a CHICKEN RACE.

OBJECT OF THE GAME

        Here's where you, the players come into the action. The cars have
        just started, heading towards the final meeting. This is a matter
        of nerves; the coolest guy will be the winner. Bongo, who for the
        occasion is clad in purple starts off the left side and controls
        his car with the Z key. Murlock is dressed yellow and steers his
        vehicle with the M. Only sissies use something else than capital
        letters.

        Good luck, commander. You'll need it.

        PS: Bongo, Murlock and Wendy are all tapeworms, if you wonder.

TECHNICAL NOTES

        This program was compiled with tasm 2.5 and tlink 3.01 from
        Borland International. In its initial form, it took up 179
        bytes, but currently only takes up 159. If I have time, I will
        add more features before the contest is over. I have included
        a file called "compile.bat" which I use for compiling.

BUGS                                                

        * Wendy cannot be seen anywhere in the game.

        * There are no airbag in Murlocks car (apart from Murlock).
