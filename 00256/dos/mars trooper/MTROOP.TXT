				  - STORY -

In the future, terrorists have taken over the world. They control everything
from a deep underground base on Mars. You have been sent to stop them.  First,
however, you have to drop down all of the way to the very core of Mars. At
first, your jet parachute doesn't open, but luckily for you it opens soon
enough. However, unluckily for you, you have a bad memory, and forgot to fill
up your oxygen tank. There is a little oxygen in some rocks on Mars that look
like this: . However, they are rare and are dispersed throughout the ground.
You must keep yourself alive by having oxygen, but you cannot have too much
(two rows of the screen is the maximum amount) because your emergency oxygen
tank will burst. Also, you cannot bump into walls because they have
electricity running through them.

				- CONTROLS -

RIGHT SHIFT  -  Moves your character to the right
LEFT SHIFT   -  Moves your character to the left

				 - SCREEN -

At the top of the screen you will find the following:

                                        A
     /-\                                               /-\
      |                                                 |
This is the amount of oxygen                        How deep you are
   you have left.                                   (A-z). This letter is
						    shown when you die.
						    This is your "score".

			       - NOTES/HINTS -

   o  To make things more difficult as you go farther downward, your
      character is moved farther downward on the screen, and thus you have
      less time to notice a wall, heart, etc.

   o  This game is different each time you play it (i.e. everything
      changes places and the landscape changes)

   o  This game only takes 253 bytes of uncompressed machine code (including
      6 bytes of data).

			    - UPDATES/BUG FIXES -

May 08, 1995 - Made an optimization so that instead of:
			       mov ax, 0b800h
			       mov es, ax
	       the program now uses:
			       push word ptr 0b800h
			       pop es
	       which saves one byte.

May 07, 1995 - Fixed the game so there would not be oxygen rocks () in
     walls. Changed the color of the "score". Version 1.2 released.

May 06, 1995 - In the previous version, the random number generator simply
     looked through memory and took each sequential byte as a random number.
     This caused a problem because numbers in memory were not really
     random. In this version, the problem is fixed, and the random number
     generator is truly random.

May 01, 1995 - First version (1.0) released.

 Also, look at my program called Ultra TwinSock, a pseudo-SLIP host
 and terminal program based on TwinSock, with scripting, VT100 emulation
 with the ability to turn off and on emulation of certain commands,
 and a nicer interface.
