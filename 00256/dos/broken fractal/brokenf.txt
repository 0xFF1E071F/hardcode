Broken Fractal
Trixter / Hornet
20160109
Based on a very, very old concept by Keith Graham.
This implementation is also necrocode, but I optimized it
at the partyplace to be under 256b.

Displays a single somewhat broken fractal image.
Hit any key to exit.
Works on 8088 + CGA if you want to wait 10+ minutes for the image.

No source until I can clean this up and maybe animate it, sorry.
