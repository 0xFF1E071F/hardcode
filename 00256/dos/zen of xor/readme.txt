-------
- for PC / intel CPU + VGA required

- no avi/mpeg - sorry, I got black screen for some reason
- stop intro by pressing any key, otherwise it runs forever
- after >2 minutes it becomes boring (I warned you)
- full source code available on request: monster@noniewicz.com
- live long and prosper
- greetz to: VOYager & Tygrys (I'd write it for ZX or C-64 if I had more time)
- everyone is granted unlimited permission to copy/distribute (if you think it's worth it)
