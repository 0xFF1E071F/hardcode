    Well here's my entry for the 256 byte game competition.  Since space
  was _very_ limited I had to assume a few things about your system:

	Numlock is ON
	System Timer is running at 18.2 ticks per second
	VGA (320x200x256) is supported

CONTROLS
ƒÕÕÕÕÕÕƒ

	up		'8'
	down		'2'
	left		'4'
	right		'6'
	quit		Just hit something (like the wall ...)

	Don't press any other key ... unless of course you you want to see
	wierd things happen!

GAMEPLAY
ƒÕÕÕÕÕÕƒ

	- There are walls surrounding you (poor snakey is trapped!)

	- The game will end once you collect 31 pieces of candy (at which
	  point snakey will be 512 sections long filling 1/8 of the play
	  field)

	- Snakey doesn't backup very well (ex. don't press down while
	  you're travelling up!)
