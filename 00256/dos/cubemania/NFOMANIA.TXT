opsys         (ms)dos, (ms)windows(95)
              we use the following: ax=00, bx=00, cx=00ff, si=0100, di=fffe
              in fact these are always satisfied.

req           theory: 386, fpu, opsys
              practice: monitor, 1500mhz <- sorry.

              <] check out the texture editor!

bugz          1) no sync. i mean if you have 10^5 mhz, it will be too fast.
                 but that one won't be a big problem for a while because:
              2a) it is really slow.. [but, it is also really short!]
              2b) you can change the speed of rotation with 
                  hacking bytes @ 73h, 77h
              3) problems may arise under windows nt.. (and win98, win2000 :)
