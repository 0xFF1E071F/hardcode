>> About
        Eyebex^Rab showed me at breakpoint2010 a new fractal formula which looked
        so awesome, that i felt in love at first sight.. for me it looks quite
        cooler than the mandelbulb stuff and is also pretty simple.. so I want
        to make atleast another demo with this formula.. but for a start this
        1k, it's my first 1k and next one will for sure have musics..

        google Tglad or read his posts at fractalforums to understand how this
        fractal was invented..        

>> Suggestions

        You need d3dx9_30.dll. the screenmode is 640x480 which should be present.
        it uses import by ordinals by which it would be preselected by most
        parties (atleast except ours..
