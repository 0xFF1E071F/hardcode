| [About]
|
| Small pong clone written for the 
| 2BUTTON GAME competition at dbf.
| The task was to write a game that
| must be controlled by no more than 
| 2 individual keys on a keyboard.
|
| A first version was released under
| the name monoPong-1k. This version
| is updated and new!
|
|
| [Usage]
| 
| The game starts immediately. Press
| ESCAPE to quit the game. Use left/
| right cursor key to control.
|
| The scoring system is shown in the
| middle screen. It represents the
| score in binary form.
