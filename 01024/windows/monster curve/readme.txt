       tufs - monster curve

code: termos (birkedal@math.ntnu.no)

needs ps3.0 keyboad monitor

a 4d julia tracer in 1024 bytes.
the different versions (high, medium, low) 
will supply different levels of detail, in
other words: the epsilon isosurface of the 
julia set varies in size.

it loops so press escape when you've had enough.

notes from author
- 4d real matrix representations of quaternions
  does not produce a smaller fragment shader
- nice to not need a vertex shader
- crinkler rules and i want it to have my babies
- tested on geforce 9800gtx+ winxp sp3
- sorry for the repetitive animation, but i'm 
  out of space and off to solskogen

fun fact
this readme is also less than 1024 bytes
