    A 1k with OGL shaders in C. Requires PS2.0.

NOTE: there are 3 exes
''''  try flow.exe first, if its too fast, try flow_slower, 
      if THATS too fast, try flow_slowest

Shaders vary in speed so much so thats why 3 exes. 

      
I first used shaders in an OGL 1k back in September 2006,
since then Ive done 6 1k intros using shaders so I finally
decided to release source code with one of them.
