Notes:
Party release only.
Uses native desktop resolution but effect is hardcoded for 1920x1080.
Not optimised, couldn't be bothered this time so needs powerful gfx card.
Tested on Win7 and Win10 with various nvidia cards.
Tested one build on AMD card but some shader code was changed since.
Original shader was a bit closer to the original with water and
better terrain but had to get cut down to fit the music.
May release multi-res/optimised version later... maybe.
