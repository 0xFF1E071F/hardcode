		In theory [!], with the latest ATI drivers this should work fine on ATI,
		but we all know this is bullshit. So, ATI might not like this. Tested on
		nVidia 8400 and 8800 [thanks Puryx!].

		Oh, requires something like SM 3.0 or 4.0; whichever supported the
		integer operations on the GPU first.

		I started the code for this intro as a simple experiment on procedural
		textures around yesterday afternoon. Then I stopped working on it for a
		few hours and finished it today [27.12.08]. I liked how the textures
		came out, so I decided to put a blob and code an interesting enough
		effect and release.

		I was at one point thinking of releasing this at tUM, but apparently
		they don't allow remote entries. And I don't wanna cheat by asking
		someone else to release it for me [actually I tried, there was just no
		one within my reach]. Thus, it ended up being a non-party release.

		Finally, MSVC compiles the very same code, size-oriented enough to be
		999 bytes, but then Crinkler doesn't like the object file...
