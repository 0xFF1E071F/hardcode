Thanks to Mic for Monjori source and Hitchhikr
for 1k framework and 1kpack packing software

Tested on PentiumD 3.0GHz / WinXP / GTS450
Assembled with nasmw.exe --- linked with 1kpack.exe
Only few values of variable "a" (line 255) are meaningful!

WebGL version at http://topopiccione.altervista.org/01_tan.html
Shader code from that page should work in Shadertoy and/or
GLSL Sandbox (not tested yet).
