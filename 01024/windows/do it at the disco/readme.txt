Requirements:

Thanks to: hitchhikr (for his 1k framework, without him I will never have released this) also mentor, auld, Blueberry (and the others) for previous technical tips and support.


Note: I didn't test it on ATI cards. If its not working for you, please tell me, I will check what can be done and will try to release a fix.
