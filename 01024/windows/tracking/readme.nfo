"Tracking" 1k intro by Drift of Onslaught
-----------------------------------------

Evolution of my previous 1k "Molten Core"
Released at TRSAC 2015.
Made for Assembly 2015 but missed the deadline.

-----------------------------------------
Needs a reasonably fast gpu, slow fps will
also screw up the music timing. Tested on
Win7 64bit with nvidia. Thanks to Gargaj
for ATI fix.

------------------------------------------
Using the latest Crinkler gave enough free
space for me to add a basic music tracker.
The data and code for the music routine is
large but compresses very well due to much
repetitiveness. Compared to more clever and
advanced 1k music routines this is just
brute force with big data tables.
I will release the source code sometime.

-----------------------------------------
Special greetings to Mentor and Blueberry.
Without Crinkler and your recent release
of the 1k specific version I could never
make an intro like this.

Greetings to Yzi/FIT for help with design
and music ideas.
