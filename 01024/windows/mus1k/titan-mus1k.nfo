        Greets to UK sceners::
	So like, yeah but, no but, yeah but, no but, yeah. Its got like a 
        totally minging synth in like 1k. Simon mallone says he swiped it
        from Vicki Skunks knickers but like he so totally lies cos his mother
        was down the docks when this was written and she never once had it
        off with Auld at least not for free. But like, no, but yeah and its 
        absolutely totally unbelieveable that this is a synth in 1k cos like
        I was doing one of those and he so totally nicked my ideas and I
        should get all the greets and creds but like you're all bitches and
        so like you know you slag it with Auld and let him touch your Strawberry
        Mivvi or sumn' most probably but it so totally stinks cos I really did 
        it.
                                  So there!

        

        WARNING:
	>>>>>>>>........As far as we know it only works on WinXP SP2
        >>>>>>>>........Yeah I know it doesnt synch
        >>>>>>>>........Colours...
        >>>>>>>>........Hitch it wont work for you and its not very good for 4k
        >>>>>>>>........Las, yeah I know I should do a 4k
