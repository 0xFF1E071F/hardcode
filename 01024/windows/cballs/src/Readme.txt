 Thanks go to Icehawk for WS_MAXIMIZE optimisation and the idea
 how to get rid of Peekmessage
 The following code sets up an Opengl window under win32
 It is double buffered, hides the mouse, has 32 bits of depth/Z.
 The main loop includes a clear for depth and color bits and 
 a swapbuffers call for drawing.
 It exits when escape is pressed...
 Tested under XP.
