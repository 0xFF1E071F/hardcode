Hello.
This is my second release at my second demoparty.
Hope you enjoy it.
It runs pretty well on my overclocked GF 8600 GT.


Thanks to Neural for 1kpack - it rocks!
Thanks to blacpawn for metaball normals.


Greetz to polish scene - especially 'Deadman'.
See you at demoparties!

And keep your balls NOT touching...
