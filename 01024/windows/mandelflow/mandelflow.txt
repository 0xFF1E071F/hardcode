1K mandelflow

Requires PS3.0 compatible card. 1024x768
And some luck.


The mandelbrot set is taken as inspiration for what I believe is a new style of fractal.
Here the equation for mandelbrot set is smoothly altered each frame. It is blended with
a julia equation, itself smoothly varying each frame.

Colours are chosen to emphasise the flow, like liquid, and the fractal itself reveals 
4 unique forms, each coloured differently. One form is the mandelbrot set itself, 
seen in yellows. Stamen, seen in blue, cube, in green and triform, in red.


No zooming and no rotation takes place, though the camera pans a little for interest.
Although the main forms repeat, each time they are seen, they are slightly different.

One drawback is that there was no room for timers, so different cards will see different 
speeds of flow. Top end cards will run too fast I am sure for which I apologise. I will 
release a properly timed version in >1k later.
