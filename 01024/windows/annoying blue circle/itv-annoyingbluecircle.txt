Annoying Blue Circle
(ABC) 

This is a 1k 
demonstrating OGL shaders 
and a midi sound system, some glorious
coder colours and an annoying blue circle. 

We hope you enjoy it.

Greets to Pirx^ind and Lord Kelvin^rbs who have been 
pushing sound at 256b forcing us try harder at 1k.

Requires: Vertex shaders and pixel shaders.
