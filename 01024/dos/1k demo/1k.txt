1k demo by Scali, for #ASM 1k democompo, 5th of December, 2001.

Well, I had a lot of plans for this 1k demo, coded quite a lot of routines
already... But then my partition died... took a while to get it fixed
(thanks comrade).
Then I upgraded to an AMD Thunderbird 1400, which gave me lots of trouble with
overheating, bad drivers, and generally lousy implementations of standards
such as AGP4x.
I managed to get the system reasonably stable, so I decided to try and piece
something together from the stuff that I had written so far... (thanks to
insomniac aswell, for helping me with the scroller).
I'd like to enter anyway, even though I could not make a respectable entry.
The more entries, the merrier :)
It's not much, but I hope it will give you a bit of that oldskool Amiga
feeling. Back in the day when everything was better, and when computers were
still made of wood, blah etc.

Well, enjoy, and prettige Sinterklaas.

Scali
