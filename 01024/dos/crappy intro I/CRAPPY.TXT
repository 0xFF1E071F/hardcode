	      Copyright (C) 1995 Albert Software Inc.



	This 1K intro contains just a horizontal starfield
 and a little scrolly. Actually it isn't bad for a first intro.
 The reason I wrote this was to find out if I am really capable of
 writing intros and demos. Now you tell me!	:)
 The code itself is about 500 bytes. The other half is the
 text for the scrolly.

	Check the source code to find out more.
 If you use this source, please greet Albert Software Inc. in your next
 demo or send me the source of one of your intros (asm). :D

BTW: This program may be used and copied freely so long as the
 applicable copyright notices are retained, and no modifications
 are made to the text, nor the code. No money can be charged for
