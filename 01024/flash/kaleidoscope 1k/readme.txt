Kaleidoscope 1K Flash 10 intro
by Shiru (shiru@mail.ru), 09'09

This is my second attempt to make small size Adobe Flash intro, and first 1K.

Requirements: Flash Player 10 or better, fast CPU to run smooth.

Source code is provided.  It is not very useful, though,  because the  way the
Flash works  is require to do  really stupid things to reduce file size,  like
replacing constants to precalculated values and use shorter names of variables
and functions. The code was compiled with Flex SDK 3.4. To get proper size you
must remove metadata (see flex-config.xml), and compile for player 10.
