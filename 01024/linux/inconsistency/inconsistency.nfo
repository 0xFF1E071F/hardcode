Inconsistency


Linux softaware rendered 1k intro with audio.

On some newer 64 bit ubuntus you need to install ia32-libs.
Prod uses SDL so make sure you have 32bit SDL installed.

Was in a bit of a hurry so the other resolutions are not all under 1024 bytes.


Special thanks to shaiggon and cce, for helping out.
