Hi there!


Here is my quick&dirty win32 conversion. Hope it will works for everybody because i only test it on a very few machines (all nvidia). This conversion is based on chocolux source, thanx Auld for sharing this. 

Currently i'm searching someone with good dx/opengl/asm/compression skills that could help me crushing down my next intro to 1024bytes. Now there around 100 bytes too much but since shader is quite my small, I think the problem come from the framework itself (almost same problem with this conversion) A custom compressor or other compiler settings could certainly do the trick.
If you think you can help me here is my adress : dark_ness10@hotmail.com

Cheers, Tigrou
