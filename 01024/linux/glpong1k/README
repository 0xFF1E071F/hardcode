Fake brings you an OpenGL Pong in 1020 bytes.

(I hate writing READMEs...)

We included the full source code.
Depending on your system the final executable will be slightly bigger or smaller.


Use W+S for the left paddle and O+K for the right paddle.
Use SPACE to wiggle the ball (haha, very funny...).

We are aware that this game might not be interesting for more like ... hmmm ... 20 hours.
We just wanted to show that it can be done.
And it can.

Feel free to abuse the "dynamic loader" in your 4K Intros,
credit/greetings would be nice ;).
And let us know if you do!

Have fun.

We might give you an update,
check http://fake.cute-ninjas.com/
now and then.
