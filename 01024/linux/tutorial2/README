a linux 1k two-triangles+shaders framework. without sound (at last!).
with sources (heavily commented in poor russian with lots of bad jokes).

code: w23 (me@w23.ru)

8 simple steps to success:
0) watch some examples
1) open shaders.inc
2) edit it with all the talent you have
3) run 'make' to compile and run it in window
4) behold what you've accomplished
5) iterate until perfection
6) run 'make batch' to generate lots of different binaries for common fullscreen resolutions
7) write greetings to all your friends (and foes)
8) pack it all together and go win a 1k/4k democompo at a nearby demoparty

tips and tricks:
- use length(gl_Vertex.xy) to get current time (no uniforms needed!)
- to easily tweak speed change number on line 219 (push 4000). smaller numbers make things faster.
