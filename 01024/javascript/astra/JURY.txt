
Dear members of the jury/compo crew,

ASTRA was tested in the latest stable versions of Opera, Chrome & Firefox.

Please use Opera or Chrome using the --allow-file-access-from-files command line flag to run the packed versions from file:\\
Firefox suffers with the glow and paths


Thanks!
