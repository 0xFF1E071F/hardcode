originally js1k.com 2015-hypetrain entry


Should work in all major new browsers. I've done couple of javascript intros before, but this is my first one at js1k.com. So this production mostly consists of a fragment shader program that does most of the visual presentation. I tried to make a shader initializer that is a bit smaller than what I've seen before. 

The name was chosen as a sign of respect to the demoscene group Peisik. 

Like PauloFalcao, Bernard of Chartres and many others have said before this was possible by standing on the shoulders 
of giants:

btw. I'm at the moment looking for a job.
