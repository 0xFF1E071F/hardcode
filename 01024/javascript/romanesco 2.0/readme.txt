The goal was to create a 1024 bytes
javascript demo, that runs in a
provided "shim" html file, which grants
equality amongst all webbrowsers and
a fair competition. 

Therefor, the resulting JS file, has
1023 bytes, but the html file, which
contains the "shim" plus the packed
JS, and which is not at all size
optimized, is much bigger.

We are planning to release a standalone
version as well, so please be patient =)
