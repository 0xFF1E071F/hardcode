LANDER 2k game compo  efnet #asm
by mcarp

kill as many aliens as you can.
land anywhere after shooting at least one alien to refuel.
higher landing spots give more fuel.
landing too hard will cost you a ship.
running out of fuel = bad, but maybe you can shoot an alien.

controls:

thrust up left right:  ARROWS
thrust down: mean old mr gravity
fire:  F & D
exit:  ESC
regen landscape:  ENTER (iffy, may crash)
