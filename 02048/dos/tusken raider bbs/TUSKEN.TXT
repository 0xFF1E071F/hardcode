This is a crappy piece of code that we put together for a BBS in Brisbane
(where we pretend to live), strangely enough called tusken raider.  We are
well aware that the effect is not very impressive to a demoscene type
person, but to someone who doesn't have much of an idea about these
things, it might look quite nice.  The whole idea here was to produce
something small that looked OK, and we think we achieved that.

This anomaly in the space-time continuum was mostly coded by gyrshroud
with some assistance from myopic fish.  Both of these "people" are
members of the "group" known as brains don't bounce :)

At this point, it would be traditional to say hello to some people that
we are pretentious enough to think are our friends.  So, in exactly that
spirit, greetings to these people:

Heretics, what's left of xtatic :), Oxygen, PoP, anyone else who
apparently exists in this country, and then a few other people too :)
