
        This is a little ad I did for Violent Crimes BBS.  Some of you may
have heard of the board, because it used to be the WHQ for DiE, but when most
of the senior members of DiE decided to leave the board was taken down, besides
most of us needed the study time.  Anyway, the board has just been reopened,
and everybody is encouraged to call.  Overseas callers will have better luck
getting through because this board has only 1 line and is always engagaed
during the day, but in the evening when most OS ppl call, the board is dead
(except for me calling at 3 am or something like that).

        Anyway, this was my first ever graphics code, and I am quite proud of
it.  I just wish the ROM font was not so crappy, because the only thing I think
that looks ordinary is the writing on the screen.

        If you have any comments about my code or whatever, then either leave
mail for me at Violent Crimes (and you will regret not calling - trust me), or
you can reach me on the inet, my address is aiy@mundil.cs.mu.OZ.AU (yes it's
my account too ...)
