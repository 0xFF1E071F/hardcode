THIS STUFF didn't fit into 2kB ... :))) do it by yourself, if you wish.
 - sandbag collision (not needed anymore, sandbag has been disabled due to size reasons)
 - WaitForRetrace do from ports - size again... I may just hope, that everyone
   has compatible BIOS with way I'm doing it...
 - better background
 - better graphics (airplanes are kinda small, but doesn't really affect gameplay)
 - badabooms
 - hide airplane after half second of badaboom
 - alternative timing (with timer, not screen refresh)
 - HiRes modes
 - draw name of game, scoring with numbers as in original game, etc...
 
 O  - = HEY MAN, DO YOUR WORK OR DIE !
