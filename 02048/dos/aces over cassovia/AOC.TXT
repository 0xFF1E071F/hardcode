 requirements: I was lazy to do whatever checks in the game, so
make sure you give it all, because it may crash your machine if
not. Anyway, there is not too much space for check-code in 2048
bytes.

 hardware:
  386+ processor (well, I would recommend at least P166 !)
  80387+ coprocessor
  about 96kB of free conventional memory (problem ?)
  VGA compatible graphics card supporting mode 320x200x256col.

 system:
  MS-DOS / Win9x / WinNT / Win2k. WinNT may have problem with
 "13h" (320x200x256) mode, but it will likely work ok.
  BIOS INT 10h call supporting ax=1001h function. (changes
  overscan color and ALSO should wait for vertical retrace)
  This again may be unsupported by WinNT, and it very likely
  will NOT work in windowed mode. (use fullscreen always)

 problems:
* game sprites are flickering (invisible), mostly in upper part
  of screen.
   - your computer is too slow for this game. It is possible to
   fix this with double buffering, but this would require some
   more memory and more sophisticated and longer code.
* game is kinda too fast ...
   - you are trying to run it in window ... go fullscreen!
   - it may be, that you have a monitor refresh rate too high
   and the game timing is dependent on that. Anyway, the faster
   = the better. The worst case may be, that the BIOS call I am
   using for delaying game does not work with your BIOS as
   expected...
* any other problem is very likely a feature or a bug, in the
  latter case please report it at ped@7gods.rulez.sk.

 story:

 Year 1914: The first world war has just began and you are the
  hero in the first air squadron of your army. Several days you
  had been taking off to shot down enemy balloons photographing
  your army positions, spying on the other side  and trying new
  plans of supporting ground attacks from air ...

 But this morning happened something definitely new.

 Your commander got an urgent message about the enemy airplane
  shooting down your balloons! Your advance in air space has
  gone within seconds in puff of smoke. But the Generality
  already got a plan, how to regain the advance.

 Yes, it's you, who will take off with the gun loaded into the
  air today, with a brand new mission. You should shoot down
  the enemy airplane! Your fingers are already twitching and
  eyes are widely openned in awaiting of new adventure in the
  blue sky. There could be just one best pilot in the world,
  and you will prove it today that your enemy is not even
  worth to be called pilot.

 Two heroes, two airplanes, one balloon, and lot of ammunition.

 Only the better one will survive...

 Controls and other stuff about game:

 ACES OVER CASSOVIA is a game for two players (no computer plr.
  available, because I'm a lazy  bastard, and the AI would took
  a serious space of these precious 2048B, and human -vs- human
  is definitely the BEST fun you could get from computer game).

 Each player has an airplane (red or green). And there's one
  unindentified balloon in the hot sector. Your commands are
  clear, shoot down both the enemy airplane and balloon.
  (for each hit you will be awarded by 1 point).

 The first player capable to collect 15 points is winner of the
  game.

 Player one controls:
   Q = turn up (from pilot's view)      X = shoot
   A = turn down                        C = take off

 Player two controls:
   Up arrow = turn up                   numpad_plus = shoot
   Down = turn down                     numpad_enter = take off

 After end of game press any "take off" button to restart game.
 Press ESC to quit game.

 Crashing into ground or into balloon tower is a suicide
 (+1pt goes to your opponent, very unpleasant experience)
 You may also hit yourself with own shot ! (suicide also)
 Hitting the upper boundary of screen will cause you to fall as
  if you were trying to climb up too fast.
 If you are falling, turn into direction you are falling and
  regain speed, otherwise be prepared to hit the ground.
 An object flying out of screen to the right/left will appear
  on the opposite side.
 I do believe, that rest of rules you will easily figure out by
  yourself.

 This game is actually not my idea, I played it for hours with
  my dad at some 8-color-128x100-pixel-resolution-console, when
  I was younger. I wish I could show you few nasty tricks we
  learned at that time, but you have to figure out by yourself.
  I'm not sure, if I did get the game play right in this
  conversion ... if you are already addicted to it, than I DID.
 And if you don't like it, than blame ME, the original was
  perfect (almost outcoming DOOM deathmatch)!

 And to all those asm gurus watching my sources and thinking
  about shrinking the code a lot ... When I was writing it, I
  focused much more at readability, than size optimising,
  because I did know, that I'll fit into 2kB easily. (what
  a fool I am ... I had hard time to fit in even with APACK)
  And it was lot faster to write it this way. So I got more
  time to write this cool TXT file with story, and other things
 (lately I even changed some parts into longer code for better
 packing results by APACK packer ! ... sometimes more is less)
