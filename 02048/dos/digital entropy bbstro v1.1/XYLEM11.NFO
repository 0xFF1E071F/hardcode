     Hello, demofreaks worldwide!  This little info file that accompanies the
fine production you just downloaded is the Xylem Information Packet version
1.1.  While perhaps not being _quite_ as important as it sounds, it will
(hopefully) provide you with all the information about the demo group Xylem
that you ever wanted to know.  If you don't know much about demos then this
file probably won't help you much.  We'd suggest finding yourself a copy of
the PC Demos FAQ by Hornet, which contains alot of informative text to help
newbies get into the scene.
     Xylem's primary purpose, of course, is to make all of it's members really
rich and powerful and famous and to take over the world.  Until we figure out
how to do that, however, we plan to release alot of these fun things called
demos, as well as some cool tunes, nice artwork and helpful utilities.  So
give this file a looksee.  Maybe you'll even find something useful in here.

 ˙+*˛È∞±≤€               IV.  Finding Our Stuff               €≤±∞È˛*+˙

     Currently, there are only two places that we know you can get all of our
productions on.  If you have Internet access, FTP to ftp.cdrom.com and look
in the directory /pub/demos.  You'll find all our stuff there, as well as
alot of other group's productions as well.
     OR if you're REALLY cool, call our World Headquarters, Digital Entropy
BBS, at 1-703-549-6982.  All Xylem releases are available for download.  We
also have over 300 Megs of demos and mods as well as the Freedom CD online
and several demo-oriented message subs.  Long distance callers are exempt from
the transfer ratio, and known demo sceners are granted more time a day.  So
give us a call!
     We are currently looking for some distro sites worldwide, so if you are
a SysOp of a demo-oriented board and are interested in distributing our files
please contact us.  We REQUIRE three things:
     1.) Your board MUST be demo-oriented, no general-interest boards, please.
     2.) You must be willing to create a file directory/conference on your
         board called "Xylem Distribution Site" or something similar and to
         place ALL of our releases in it.
     3.) You must have access to Internet mail and FTP, OR call Digital Entropy
         AT LEAST once a month to obtain our new releases.
     We'll probably also want to know stuff like your name, other groups you
are affiliated with, number of users on your system, etc.  Email Loki
(radams@mail.erols.com) or call Digital Entropy to get in touch with us.
     If you maintain an Internet FTP site with demo directories on it, contact
us about becoming an internet distribution site.
     So what's in it for you?  Here are the benefits:
     1.) You get to obtain all our new releases before anybody else does.
     2.) You get to put us in your long list of distro sites :).
     3.) We'll put your BBS name and number or FTP site address in all of our
         future releases.
     Sound good?  I thought so too!  Give us an email today!

     We're still working on this section, but it's getting a little long, so
it will probably appear on our web page when it's complete.  If you REALLY
want to read this section, check a more recent version of this info file for
the web address.


 ˙+*˛È∞±≤€                VI.  Current Projects               €≤±∞È˛*+˙

     This list is, of course, subject to incessant change, so don't be
alarmed if you don't find some of these projects in the predicted
deadlines. ;)

--- "Endoscope" is the codename of a musicdisk Zoner is producing as we
                speak. It will feature 6 of his worn out songs he deems
                releasable. date: 10/1996

--- "Web Page"  is the name of the thing Loki is developing at the moment
                It will be an informative bit of the net and will most
                certainly be a nice stop for most demosceners as there
                will be countless hot links and stuff online. date: 10/1996

--- "Mystery    Now this is something to look for. We don't know the name
       Intro"   of this intro yet, or anything, but we know we are going to
                do an intro just for the fun of it pretty soon.. :)
