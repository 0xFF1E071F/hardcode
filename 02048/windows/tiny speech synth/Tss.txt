Description
===========
This is a simple speech synth subroutine, based on formant synthesis theory. 
Speech is synthesized by passing source excitation signal through set of formant one-pole filters.
Excitation signal is a sawtooth or noise (depending on sound type), although you can try other signals.


Some explanation on design
==========================
It was surprisingly hard to find any information on formant synthesis. Of course, there is a lot of
information on the Internet, but the biggest part of it is just a general words of theory, 
nothing practically usable. The biggest problem was to find concrete formant frequencies.
After reading a lot of articles I found that I knew nothing new, compared to my knowledge before reading...
So I did frequency analysis by myself. I recorded my own voice and analyzed it's FFT. Analysis is VERY
approximate and incomplete, so it causes bad speech quality.


Terms of use
============
This program is free for use, and you can use it for any purposes you want, as long as you specify
my name in you program source code and description.
