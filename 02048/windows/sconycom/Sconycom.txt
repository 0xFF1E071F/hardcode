Compo:   4K intro
Code by: Stan/Rebels

Requires d3dx9_32.dll to run. Not tested on any computer other my own. Yes, that's horrible.
Precalc time approximately 20 seconds. 

It supposed to be 1k intro but I have no time to finish it because 2010 is coming.
Snowman tells you "Stop COding New Year is COMing!".
Happy new year and all the best!
