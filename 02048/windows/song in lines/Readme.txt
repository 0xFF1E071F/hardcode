Hello

This is a Win32 port of 1k intro "Song in lines",
known from 8 bit computers ZX Spectrum / PMD85 / C64.
Unfortunatelly, according to win32 platform specifics,
we did not fit the 1k limit of intro length.

Main graphic effect repeats after cca 1 minute.
But in fact, repeat comes after very long time
because repeating of effects is processed
with another coordinates and colors of lines.

You can use classic key ALT+F4 for end of intro.
No any other control keys are there.

There are a short 8-bit chip-like stereo music,
over 1 minute long. All music data takes 222 bytes,
code needed for interpreting this data and generating
PCM wav data (Stereo 16 bit 44100 Hz) takes 284 bytes
(139 bytes ported player and 145 bytes chip emulation).

		Busy and Noro.
