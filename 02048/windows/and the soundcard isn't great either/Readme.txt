And The Soundcard Isn't Great Either by Fulcrum
===============================================
An executable graphic entry for the Demodays 2013 surprise compo, the topic was: "This app can't open. The screen resolution is too low for 'Music' to run."

I was hoping to make a 1K out of this, but its 96 bytes too large. I'd have to cut the reflections (and it looks bad enough as is) or convert everything to assembler/HLSL/1KPack, and I'm not going to spend even more hours byte-hunting. This is my 3th release in 2 months, I've done enough partycoding.

Dude, it's a party-coded almost-1K executable gfx! If it doesnt run on your HW, just watch the screenshot...
