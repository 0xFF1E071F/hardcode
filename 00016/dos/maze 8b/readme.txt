"Maze 8b" by HellMood / DESiRE

My take on tiny maze generators.
After seeing the smallest versions
so far (10-13 Byte), i wondered
if breaking the 8 Byte barrier
would be possible ... and it turns
out it is =)

Like other small versions, "maze 8b"
depends on the memory content, it 
looks decent on MSDOS 6.22 and
Windows XP, but very poor on DosBox.

See the previous history of tiny mazes
