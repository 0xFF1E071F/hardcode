After i saw so much sierpinski stuff on pouet
i decided to also contribute some sierpinksi

i managed to break the 16 byte barrier. this
looks a little distorted, but on the other hand
you can alter the color with the keyboard =)

on a real MS Dos, you can also move the mouse
to alter the color. beware of teh eye cancer :D

A video of me, coding and executing this under
MS Dos 6.22 ( Virtual Box ) is available

this also works with a Dos Box (0.74)
