Rainbars 16b by HellMood/DESiRE
-------------------------------

Released September 2015

16 bytes demo effect for MSDOS
Tested with DosBox, WinXP Dos, MsDos (VirtualBox)

I was curious : is it possible to create
something like "rainbox32b" in 16 bytes?

Well, kind of :) 

But no ESC support this time ;)
