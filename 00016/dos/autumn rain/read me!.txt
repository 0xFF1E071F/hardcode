my second released demo "autumn rain"

inspired by "glitchy rainbow" from Suborg
http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61976


i aimed for the smallest bytesize while
having a screen filling animation effect

you can watch a video of me, coding and 
executing the program with "debug" on 
MS Dos 6.22 running on Oracle Virtual Box 4.3

it has also been tested vor DOSBox 0.74
... it works ;) animation is way faster
