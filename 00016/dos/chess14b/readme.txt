Chess14b, a ... program for MSDOS ^^

I'm a fan of the work of both Baudsurfer and
Oscar Toledo. If ~ literally ~ anything can
be done in <17 bytes, it automatically raises
my interest. Any if i ever would play Sopiko
Guramishvili (the gorgeous beauty on the
"screenshot") in real life, i would exactly
do what my program suggests â™¥
