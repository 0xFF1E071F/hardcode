   http://mift0.da.ru

 # inspired of fr-016 / fr-016b / fr-016c
   ( they forgot to pack it :)
   my first tribute to the scene and the winner of
   top-10 world crap releases.

 # there are 8 versions of intro, the only two
   are represented as you can see :)
   Decided to upload it when found same shit in
   19 bytes on pouet... Would anybody like to
   do it in 64k ? maybe demo ?
