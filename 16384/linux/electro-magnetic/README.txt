 Abstract:
  In this thesis, we propose an efficient
  algorithm for doing realtime path tracing.
  We propose a modern pipeline utilizing DDA's,
  wave propagation and LaRusse Fireclouds to
  achieve ultra-realistic image quality that
  rivals path tracing and might very well lead
  the next step in graphics hardware evolution.


 A few word from our sponsors:
  The upcoming HV-666 (PCI-e implementation of
  the latest Jupiter 666 Hardware Standard), is
  100% compatible with the existing Jupiter 666
  computer ecosystem.

  Features include:
   - Per pixel time interpolation
   - Our famous Accelerated DDA rendering (HDDA)
   - Full integration with C/OS
   - Virtual Gordon 

  HV-666 will ship Q3 and will have a suggested
  retail price of $399.

  It will also be compatible with the next
  generation of Jupiter 666 software by including
  the additional Hackers NEW SID implementation.

  NEW SID is also a drop in replacement for the
  original SID chip on your Commodore.
