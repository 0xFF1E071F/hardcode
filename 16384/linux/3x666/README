** How do I compile this???

Check out the makefile (VIDEO and AUDIO) and config.h (BUFW and BUFH)
and change the values appropriately :) Then type make.

You need an X window system or svgalib, 8 bits per pixel. You may need
to change the lib setting in the makefile to point to your Xlib dir.

Tested on i386linux, aix (ibm rs/6000) and sun. Audio only works on linux,
freebsd etc.

** I only have an Alpha, is it enough for watching this demo???

This phukken multimedia show runs reasonably smoothly on an 386 machine
(about 20x faster than most of today's msdos intros ;) in a 320x200
window.

The palette is ugly, the effects lousy. Hope you still enjoy it :)

** The binary

The packet also contains a precompiled executable for dummies only.
(Linux i386 shared elf svgalib devdsp 320x200x256, run as root)

You should know it is very rude to spread suidroot binaries like this
so if you care about the security of your system, just delete the bin
and forget it!

Who cares. Use it in the spirit of gnu. But we'd hope you credit us if
you take pieces out of it :)
