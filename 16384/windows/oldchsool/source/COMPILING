Quick and dirty guide to make it:

- Just type make and follow the instructions
- Or just do make <your desired systype>

The available systypes are: unix, linux, hpux, cygwin, win32

The experience on previous versions of pwplib also suggests succesful
compilation on the following platforms:
   - Solaris/SPARC (without sound support; also with native compiler)
   - AIX/PowerPC (without sound support; also with native compiler)

We hope to support even more platforms (such as msdos, palmos,
macos and msx) in the future.

We will release a final version sometimes after the party (Proxy 2001),
hopefully with tested+easier compilation.
