                       ikanim megamix 2012   
                      Released at TRSAC 2012
                        64 kb intro compo
	
Credits
=======
Code: Psycho (psycho@loonies.dk)
Music: Punqtured / Fnuque  (LNS FMSynth remix of original by Booster)
Synth: Blueberry
Original animation setup & data: Blueberry

Crinkler (1.3) used for compression.


Compatibility
=============
DirectX 11 graphics card.
(There is a known problem with nvidia R304(an onwards?) drivers and crinkler, so until
we can find the exact course all crinkled intros have to be run on older drivers)
Update: Added workaround for nvidia shader compilation bug, fixing cameras.

Precalc (shader compilation) is fully multi threaded, but still expect some time..


Info
====
This is a remix of ikanim, our amiga intro from BreakPoint 2004:  http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12042

While some of the scenes are based on realtime versions of procedurals 4ks:
Bujr Babil - BreakPoint 2010 - http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=54544
Maybe the real party is outside - Revision 2012 - http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=59091
(Dawn in the dead sponge - Solskogen 2012 - http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=59466 )

All made possible by my 16/64k minded raymarch engine, providing several times speedup over the usual naive 
approach, but far out of reach for a 4k intro.
Wanted to make this 8k, but that would cost a scene, and hey! 8 or 9k in a 64k compo shouldn't matter too much.
