rastro by andude / guild
since nobody needs to do
raster effects anymore i
decided to code this lil
r   a    s    t    r   o
needs 486 dx4 or pentium
'cause it does a lot per
scanline and i'm so used
to coding for pentium it
will probably suck for a
486.  take a look though
it's pretty cool.  fully
justifying nfo text with
no extra spaces is kinda
hard. :) okay, i'll stop
