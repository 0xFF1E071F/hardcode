This program demonstrates both 3 dimensional rotation and dithering of 4096
colors for the Enhanced Graphics adaptor.  Press SPACE BAR for successive
windows, ESC to exit.

This program was written in Microsoft C 4.0 on a Compaq 386 and does not use
any floating point arithmetic.  xxx87 processors will have no effect on
execution speed.  Slower than mollasses on an 8088, bearable on an AT,
impressive on a 12Mhz AT, but amazing on a 386.  If you can get this program
to a fast machine, try it...you'll like it.
