-Quick introduction :

  hey hi dudes ! 
  Chalice is (somehow) proud to release their first intro :)
  nothing special ...
  but coooool :) .. i have to type thiz otext fucking fast because
  if i do not hurry up .. thiz file will never make it to the nexus
  party 95 !

-Quick requirements :

  eyks ! i really dunno ! but we've tested thiz intro on a 33mhz 
  and a pentium both had no problems with it .. 
  if you want to hear sound ( adlib music by FC [*]) you need a 
  Soundblaster ... 
  [*] sorry we tried to use our own music but somehow our musicplayer
  totaly fucked up! next time dudes :)
