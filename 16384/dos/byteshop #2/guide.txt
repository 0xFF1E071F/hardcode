COMPLETE USER'S GUIDE


Diskmag is DOS-executable, so you were warned.
"Fullscreen me beautiful" shortcut tries to run diskmag in fullscreen (you can
do the same in right-click-on-exe options), because running in non-fullscreen
under Windows don't gives you bar, smooth scrolling and non-standard font. If
you have Vista or 7, hate Microsoft and use DOSBox.


Keys:
Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End - scrolling
Space - hide/show bar
Esc - exit
