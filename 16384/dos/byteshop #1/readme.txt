issue one


Diskmag is DOS-executable, so you were warned.
"Windows me beautiful" shortcut tries to run diskmag in fullscreen (you can do
the same in right-click-on-exe options), because running in non-fullscreen
under Windows don't gives you bar, smooth scrolling and non-standard font. If
your Windows version don't supports fullscreen console, hate Microsoft and use
DOSBox.


Keys:
Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End - scrolling
Space - hide/show bar
Esc - exit
