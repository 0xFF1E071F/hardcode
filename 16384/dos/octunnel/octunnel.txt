OCTUNNEL
========

Octagonal flatshaded tunnel effect
(c)2003 Peter Gordon (pete@shagged.org)

I was bored, I was away from my Amiga (damn it), and I felt like a programming
challenge, so I loaded up Borland Turbo PASCAL 7 on my parents PC (Pentium II
333Mhz, crappy £8 graphics card), and tried to make a nice tunnel effect.

1 evening of coding later, and here is the result:


 OCTUNNEL.EXE - Just your basic flatshaded 3D tunnel
 OCTUNNL2.EXE - As above, but with glowing sparks travelling with you
 OCTUNNL3.EXE - Two tunnels, inner one with windows so you can see through
 OCTUNNL4.EXE - As above, but with the glowing sparks again

If you compile these yourself in Borland Turbo PASCAL, and you get a Runtime
error from your exe's, you need the "fast computer" CRT.TPU patch. You'll have
to google for that.

Cheery bye,
Pete
