                   The second BlasterSound BBS intro.

        ------------------------------------------------

           The original idea for this intro comes from one of the
        very first ASM routines that JCAB and I coded, long ago, on
        the ZX Spectrum. We liked the way it looked, and as it
        seems that this year we will not have snow in Madrid, we
        brought the concept back. :-) Of course, we have improved it
        (more pixel resolution and a random windy thing).

        ------------------------------------------------

           I had never thought that a screen had so many pixels. Just
        wait until it fills completely!

        ------------------------------------------------

           The music of this intro can be heard through an AdLib card
        or compatible (i.e. Sound Blasters, PAS's, etc) or with an
        MPU SCC1 or compatible General Midi device (also works with
        the MegaEm and the GUS card). In fact, if you have both cards
        on your computer, you can hear the music twice as much! 8->
