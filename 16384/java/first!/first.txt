First demo ever by waffle of ExHouse
12K java applet ascii 80x50 intro

---

Run it in a web browser!
Sounds didn't work on appletviewer(Linux j2se 1.4.2_04) for some very strange reason!

Requirements:
- CPU 1GHz+  - Tested with 1.3GHz (Works fine on Linux but MIDI lagged in Windows)
- MIDI support
- Java Runtime Enviroment(Definitely works with 1.4)

HUGE AMOUNT OF FUCKINGS TO LAMERFEST ORGANIZERS!
