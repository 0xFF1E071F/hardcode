"Arabeske 64" - by HellMood
released September 2015

sizeoptimized and varied from
"Arabeske" by Frank Buss (fb@frank-buss.de)

see http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66428

I tried to mimic the original as close as possible

"arabes62" behaves like the original with parameter 63 (dies)
"arabes64" is a little tweak that i found to be nice
"arabes65" behaves like the original, but is 65 bytes ;)

note : this is tested only for DOSBOX yet. it might work
elsewhere, it might not ;) if i find time and motivation
i might look deeper into this, but for now this was
just my evening sizecoding meditation =)


EDIT:

after some further optimizations, the shortest version
has now 55 bytes. i added all versions, plus
their 5 bytes bigger ESCapeable versions to the archive
