"Autumn 64b" by HellMood / DESiRE

MSDOS sizetro / procedural graphics

This 64 byte sizetro does not do much
besides displaying an digital impression
of autumn. Press ESC to quit.

The standard version to use is "aut1024p.com"
This would be 1280x1024 pixels in VESA Mode 0x107

In case of emergency use the lower resolution
versions, i'd be very happy if you'll be able
to show the original though ;)

This should work on every VESA compatible system.
If what you see while testing, differs from the
screenshots i appended, please contact me and
i'll try to fix it =)

I'll upload the demo to Pouet after the party ;)
