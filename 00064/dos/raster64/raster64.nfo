	Raster64, an 64byte intro
	by Optimus/Dirty Minds/Nasty Bugs
	Compiled with NASM
	---------------------------------
       
	This is my first intro on X86 asm ever!
	And I am a very very bad newbie (A small background on Z80 asm only)
	And the space is toooo small :(
	So please don't bite me, ok? :P
	I love tiny intros though =)


	INFO: Color cycling of a perspective-like thing using raster/cooper fx in textmode!
	KEYS: Escape to quit

	WARNING: Don't run under pure windows (Freeze! CLI must be the reason)
	Run only through DOS box or pure DOS..
	And prefer pure DOS for that, cause perhaps the sync still fuxx up..
