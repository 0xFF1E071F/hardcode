fr0.1: constant evolution
0a000h 64byte compo entry

----

it's now 16:10 on saturday, the code is finally finished and i'm kinda
proud that i managed to squeeze this cheesy tunnel effect into 64bytes.
no multiple versions this time - everything i want is in 64 bytes, and
that's all there is to it.

good day everyone, and greets to all who deserve it - refer to fr-024
for an incomplete listing.

oh, yeah, source included, though it's rather pointless for a 64b
intro. who cares.
