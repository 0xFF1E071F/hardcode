Gingerbread Man 2!
--------

A 64b prod by lord Kelvin.

My third release... Midsommer wasn't useless, I rearranged bytes in 128b g/b man and now he's two times smaller. But without cool palette. But with Esc button, that was really interesting!

Compiled with FASM.

Great hello from Russia.=)
