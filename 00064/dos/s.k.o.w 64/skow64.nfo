       Some Kind Of Wobbling - A 64 Bytes Intro

        code: Nimrod

        Well, these tiny FR-Intros inspired me 
        to try to code something similar and here 
        it is. It was my first attempt  using a  
        stand-alone Assembler and it's not that 
        impressive, but it was fun to make.

        It runs fine on my Win98SE, but I didn't 
        test it on another OS, so maybe it can 
        cause problems.
