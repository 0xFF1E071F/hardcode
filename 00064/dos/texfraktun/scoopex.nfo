ryg of farb-rausch claimed this was ripped... now here the FINAL comments...


I have just talked with ryg about this and it is now ok for both sides.
While coding this someone else not demoscene related at all helped me with some 'hints' 
(which I am also sure now it was coded by ryg).
So... let's make it public that I coded the VGA 13h mode stuff+sierpinski texture (texfrakfire.com - 
was the beginning of this project), and the 'tunneling' was coded by ryg (even if wasn't aware of 
it... this cutting a long story).
Anyway I would never ever release this if I knew there was anything ripped and thank ryg a lot for 
being understanding with me.

yeah, nothing more to add. 
and now let's close that case and start working on productions again :)
