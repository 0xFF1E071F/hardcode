a 32b / 64b MSDOS tiny intro
by HellMood / DESiRE
coded for fun in June 2016
no party in sight with a tiny category
to publish this, so it's set free
into the wild ^^

-------------------------------------------

tested on MsDos, Win XP NTVDM, DosBox 0.74

-------------------------------------------

this is the MSDOS port of "Zoompinski"
a 512b intro from "Plush" for C64
http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=67284

the 63 bytes version tries to mimic every
detail (colors, alignment) as close as
possible while staying inside the 64b
border, because C64 =) Quit via ESCape ;)

the 31 bytes version just tries to stay
inside the 32b border, while showing the
basic effect, a zooming sierpinksi triangle.
to my knowledge this is the first zooming
sierpinski effect in the 32b category =)

as a bonus, the smallest animated
sierpinski effect i know of, in 10 bytes
but without zoom ;) it's derivated from
"colpinski" from myself. propz to "frag"
from fsqrt for helping me crunch this
thing down so hard (y)
