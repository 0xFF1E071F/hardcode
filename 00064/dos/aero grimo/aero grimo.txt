A 64b prod by lord Kelvin.

It`s my first attempt to create demo with a nonsense name.
The idea was to create shade bob in 64b.
This is the result of "optimization with loss of quality".
At least it doesn`t use coder`s colors. It uses coder`s palette.

Compiled with FASM.

Great hello from Russia.
