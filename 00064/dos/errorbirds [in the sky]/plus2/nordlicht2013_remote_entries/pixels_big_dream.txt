compo:  gfx (newschool)

tools:  - paint
        - micrografx picture publisher 8
          (okay, that is oldschool ;) )
        - 1 mouse 1 finger

info:   I wanted to contribute something to
        Nordlicht but I was not coding in the
        past weeks and my brain is busy with
        other things at the moment. So I
        thought a little gfx would be nice :D

        Compo team please consider that work
        stage #4 is the final work (=

greets: Everyone at the party place and all
        sizecoders :D
