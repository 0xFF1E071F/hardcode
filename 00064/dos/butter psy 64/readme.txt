
not motivated enough to write a readme, so have
a copy of my mail to the qbparty organizers


P.S. ringz HD was kinda rushed, i did not save
the final asm, the last one was 230 bytes
with the final DESiRE Logo missing and maybe
something else i don't see right now :P

Hello there =)

hereby, i send you three entries for the 256b compo.
All entries quit on ESC (use discoESC.com for the 3rd)

1.) "ringz HD by DESiRE"
executable name : ringzhd.com
notes : this needs to run on a FAST computer with
a REAL dos (Windows XP NTVDM should to it, too)
it attempts to switch to VESA 800x600 and is already
aspect ratio corrected to run in HD (1080p / 720p)

2.) "Butter Psy 64b by DESiRE"
executable name : psy64b.com
notes : -

3.) "Disco 64b by DESiRE"
executable name : disco64b.com OR discoESC.com
notes: the 64b version CAN NOT be quit with ESC
so i added a ESCapeable version (68 bytes) for
convenience. Both versions are already aspect ratio
corrected to run in HD (1080p / 720p)
