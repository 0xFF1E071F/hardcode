fr-017: area 51
0a000h 64b intro compo entry (placed 1st)
by ryg/farbrausch
(source+different versions included)



those are several builds, area51.com is the smallest
rotzoom I managed to do, nice.com is a faster and more
compatible version, and colorful.com includes a nicer
palette donated by mad/os of wildmag team (thank you).

feel free to twiddle around with it or send me a smaller
version if you like to.
