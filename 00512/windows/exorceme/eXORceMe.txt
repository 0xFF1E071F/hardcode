Another 512 byte intro for windows.
Compiled with yasm, compressed and linked with crinkler. 

Based on DrainBamage by rudi 
	http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61828
Better visuals, and featuring: 
	GetAsyncKeyState(VK_ESCAPE) and ExitProcess(0)
Linked with:
	/CRINKLER /COMPMODE:SLOW /ORDERTRIES:20 
	/HASHTRIES:300 /HASHSIZE:50 /UNSAFEIMPORT

I challenge you to do better 512 byte intros using crinkler :)
