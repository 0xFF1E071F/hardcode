Hephaestus (Greek God of Fire)

What you are looking at here is a 512 byte win32 executable that
imports it's functions by hash. sets up a gdi32 window and blits
a pixel buffer to the screen then escapes on any keydown. It has
been tested on XP and Windows7 (Vista untested), and it seems to
runs smoothly on all platforms tested. No packer was used in the
development of this executable. Final size of prod is 512b.

I hope that this prod will help some 256b coder to move on to XP
and Windows7 development while enjoying similar constraints.
