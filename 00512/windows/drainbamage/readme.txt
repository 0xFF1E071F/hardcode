RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Here you go..
Pants down...
A fucking 512 byter for windows that actually came out of my ass..

Uncompressed took 2048 bytes.
After crinkler-compression its 511 bytes.

Tested on Windows 7(?) and 8.

| After you run the .exe you might not be able to quit.
| For safeness use two monitors and use the TaskManager
| on the other monitor and end the task there.

There was not enough room for:
	ChangeDisplaySettings(&dmScreenSettings, CDS_FULLSCREEN);
	GetDC(CreateWindow("edit",0,WS_POPUP|WS_VISIBLE,0,0,WIDTH,HEIGHT,0,0,0,0));
	GetMessage(&msg,NULL,0,0);
	GetAsyncKeyState(VK_ESCAPE);
  and...
	ExitProcess(0);

No C code where harmed during the making of this shitty prod.
No asm where used.
Compiler and Linker options where buttfucked.

Thanks for watching this piece of crap.
