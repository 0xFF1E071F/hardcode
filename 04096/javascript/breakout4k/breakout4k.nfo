A 4k Javascript Breakout clone
written in 2007 by mihi <schierlm@gmx.de>

This is my first "demo", so thumb me down if you don't like it.

System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Tested on: Firefox 2, Opera 9, Internet Explorer 7
- JavaScript must be enabled
- Music output may not work depending on a plugin
- SFX output currently works only in Firefox, and only
  if music is disabled.
- A mouse is required, speakers or headphones are recommended

Controls
~~~~~~~~

Click to start a ball or to pause/unpause game. Click the 
Music/SFX/Off link to switch sound output. Try to remove all
blocks from the screen and collect powerups.

- blue powerup: extra ball
- gray powerup: racket widener
- red "powerup": racket shrinker

You have 5 balls. Every block hit gives you 10 points, or
20 points if the block has been removed completely.

Options
~~~~~~~

You can start the game with options:

index.html      - normal mode
index.html?m    - muted mode
index.html?s    - simple mode (no copper bar or starfield)
index.html?ms   - simple and muted

Try the simple mode if your browser cannot handle all those
1px divs from the starfield or if it the game is awfully 
slow. The mute mode is - obviously - for situations where
you may not make any noise.
