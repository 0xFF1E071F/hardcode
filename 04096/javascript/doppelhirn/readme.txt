This little 4k browser intro uses or is based on:

    - distance functions by iq / rgba [1]
    - ray marching code by Paolo Falcao [2]
    - Shader Minifier by LLB / Ctrl-Alt-Test [3]
    - js-sonant and setup code by Marcus Geelnard (marcus256) [4][5][6]
    - JsExe by cb / adinpsz [7]

So, obviously, I did not really do anything myself. If the sound is somewhat
horrible, that is because I ripped apart marcus256's synth renderer beyond
recognition, and certainly not js-sonant's fault.

Also, the file is a bit larger than it needs to be, which is not JsExe's fault,
either. I had some bytes to go to fill 4096 bytes and no idea what else to add,
so I took JsExe's output file and converted it to a valid PNG (with correct
checksums and an IEND chunk). This may increase compatibility with future
browser versions, who knows?

Special thanks to element for making the tune suck less.
