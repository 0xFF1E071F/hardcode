DUCK.3JS, the famous DUCK.3DS reimplemented in JavaScript.

There are  2 files,  duck.html is the  4k version with  some triangles
removed,  duck_hq.html is the  "full" version  with (nearly)  the same
vertices as duck.3ds


This demo uses a canvas. It was tested under Opera 9.63 and Firefox 3.
Safari was not tested, but should also work.

       DUE TO MISSING CANVAS SUPPORT IN IE, IT WILL NOT WORK IN
			  INTERNET EXPLORER!

Sorry about that, I might hack up an IE compatible version soon.

Some technical information for those interested:

The  triangles are drawn  using a  canvas path.  So we  draw triangles
directly and not pixel per pixel.

This  also  means we  cannot  use  a  Z-buffer. Therefore,  the  pixel
painters algorithm is used: for  every frame, all triangles are sorted
according to  their Z  coordinate, and drawn  in that  order (farthest
first). To minimize  artifacts and to speed up drawing  a bit, we also
perform back-face culling.  There is also a single  point light source
to lighten the triangles.

To keep the data small, the following methods are used:

- Only one side of the duck is stored

- Only one byte per coordinate is stored

- Furthermore,  both  code  and  vertex  data is  LZW  compressed  and
  uncompressed by JS before starting.



Don't let duck.3ds die ;-)

If  you want  to reach  me, an  email to  joghurt@wur.st might  do the
