1. Story

In 2084, Robotron valiantly attempted to save his own life after the demise of
the last family. He continued to gain powerups, nuclear bombs, shields, and
other defenses against the robot invasion. However, just before the robots
were able to overwhelm Robotron, he was suddenly snatched from their grasp
by an unknown force! 

Displeased that a human still remained alive somewhere, the robots hatched a
plan. They would build a time device that would pull Robotron into the future,
just before he disappeared. 

The robots spent over two-thousand years on the project, and in that time they
came up with a new battleplan. Robotron's weapons were far too effective. The
only method that worked for defeating him was to overwhelm him to where he
could no longer stave off the avalanche of attackers. Thus the robots began
mass production of the inexpensive Hoover Vacuum Cleaner robot, as well as a
more heavily shielded mechbot. It was felt that these should be able to 
overwhelm Robotron without overstraining the robot economy's resources.

On January 23, 4096, the robots (unaware of the causality loop they were about
to produce) snatched Robotron from the year 2084 and placed him in an arena
with invisible forcefield walls. This time the robots were certain that they
would finally be victorious...

  * You're faster than the robots. Use that to your advantage!
  * Keep moving! The more you move, the harder it is for robots to follow.
  * When in doubt, charge! They won't expect it! ;-)

Special thanks goes to Caspian Prince for inspiring the Robotron ripoff, to
