Overview
--------
BoxBot4k (which is a clone of the famous Sokoban game) is an entry for the 2010
Java 4K Game Programming Contest. The goal of the contest is to develop the
best game possible within four kilobytes (4096 bytes) of data.

Game rules
----------
The goal of the game to push boxes around a maze and try to put them in
designated locations (squares with red pattern) by controlling a robot. Only
one box may be pushed at a time, and boxes cannot be pulled.

The game contains 50 levels which are based on Francois Marques' Novoban
levelset with some modifications.

* Arrow keys: move the robot
* Backspace: restart level
* PgUp/PgDn: go to next/previous level

Usage
-----
Java 5 or later is recommended to run the game.

  (e.g.  double click the `boxbot4k-app-1.0.1.jar`).
  You can also run the game from the command line by typing:

        java -jar boxbot4k-app-1.0.1.jar

* Applet: Open `boxbot4k-applet-1.0.1.html` in a web browser which supports
  Java applets.
