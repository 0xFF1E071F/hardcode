/**
 * Yep. here it is. the source code for a simple java 4k I wrote for the
 * demoparty "Mainframe". It competed in the 4k compo, and also in the "GNU demo
 * award" where it's source code was judged. So that is why I have tried to
 * comment this code a little :)
 *
 * <p>
 * And yes... The song used in this intro (it is made by zantac btw,
 * http://www.zantac.tk) has been used before... BUT I could
 * not make it fit in less than 4k then, so it's ok anyway ;)
 *
 * <p>
 * Also this intro uses sun-classes for audioplayer (notice the
 * "import sun.audio.*" above). these are not standard so it is possible that
 * this intro does not work with your java-version
 *
 * <p>
 * It does however work with
 * <li>Internet Explorer 3 and up
 * <li>Netscape version ????
 *
 * <p>
 * OH! the compo version was compiled with
 * <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java">Microsofts java compiler</a> and
 * then obfuscated with <a href="http://www.retrologic.com">Retroguard</a>
 *
 * <p>
 * Hello to everyone I know. (what? I'm lazy... ;))
