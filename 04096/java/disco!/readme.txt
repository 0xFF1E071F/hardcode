Disco!

A 4k intro made by Efe of Thp for Assembly 04.

To start the demo simply double-click on the jar
or type:

java -jar Disco.jar

Windowed mode supported, type:

java -jar Disco.jar windowed

Note: Use a subwoofer for better sound!

Intro uses desktop resolution on fullscreen
and 800x600 on windowed mode. Therefore it
requires quite powerful machine to run,
(Coded and tested on Athlon XP 2500 + Radeon 9500)
try to reduce resolution if it runs too slow. 
(Music gets all mixed up)
Windowed mode window can be resized using standard
operation system methods supported by jre.

Requirements:

-Java 1.4
-Fast machine
-Sound card / chip with streaming audio support.

Intro runs about 2 minutes on a fast machine and
then quits. You can also quit any time by pressing
ESC-key.
