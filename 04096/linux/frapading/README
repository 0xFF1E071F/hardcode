Ok,

this is my entry to the 4Kb intros compo of the ltp 3 (1999 edition).
Organizers wanted sound ? ok, let's 'em have it !

It's not serious, please don't blame me.

I know it to work under linux kernels 2.2.1 and 2.0.33.
Maybe it won't work on other kernels (not tested)
(but it is highly probable it will, anyway).

It you get troubles with it, don't hesitate to contact me.
