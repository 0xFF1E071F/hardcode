if it doesn't work right away then please have a look
at the code first; most of it was written at the
party place -- when we were really tired.

yes we used libggi for debugging. note that you have
to be root in order to run this demo. it's not only
svgalib but also the ugly palette switching by
directly accessing the ports. feel free to change this
to libggi or X11, but make sure it fits in 4096 bytes
