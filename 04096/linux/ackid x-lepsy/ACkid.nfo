Building from source:

chmod +x ./4k.make
./4k.make
./4k

.. You might want to stab the binaries
to change resolution and fullscreen mode.
You also might want to change the -Os
to -O3 in 4k.make because I fail at coding
and this  barely worked even on the kompo
comp :))))

The unoptimized binary takes args
for resolution and fullscreeny
-w <res>
-h <res>
--no-fullscreen
./ACkid_unoptimized -w 1280 -h 1024 --no-fullscreen

No args, falling to default which are: 1280x1024,
fullscreen

Done with: SDL, GL, GLU. OS's 64bit Linux.

The big screen version's source nor binary
we do not have. However, what was changed
was resolution and few optimizations because
Assembly's recording devices SUCKED BALLS!
Worked all fine in jury, the "real" version
worked just like the recorded version.

AND GREETINGZ ARE SENT TO:

The scene, minus PC lamers. (including ourselves)


..those who helped tzaeru to get from
Boozembly in single (..I think?) piece.
Thanks for the free beer and whatever
I was given!
..and np1 for helping tzaeru off the
arena. It's Monday afternoon and I still
have a hangover from Saturday, fuck it.


Fuckings to:

Those responsible of Assembly's recording
devices.
