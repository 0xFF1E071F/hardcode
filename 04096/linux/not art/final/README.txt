
      	Not Art - Final version
    an intro4k for Euskal Party 13
            by NecroStudios

		------

 * CREDITS:
 
	Raytracer & Scenes: Lemoniac / NecroStudios
	Softsynth, Music, crappy win32 port: slack / NecroStudios
	MacOS port: PpluX / NecroStudios


 * NOTES:

	  This is the final version of the intro. The metaballs now cast
	shadows, some graphical glitches were fixed, and it's smaller than 
	party version, as it should be :)
	
	  Win32 and MacOS ports are included, as well as a linux executable
	for i686 (the party version was only for pentium4 due to size problems).
	Sources	for the linux version are included, too. There is not too much 
	platform-specific code, and porting is easy, but contact us if you want
	the sources for the ports.
	  

 * SPECIAL THANKS TO:
 
 	- Fit and Bandwagon for their 4k sources: the GCC flags you used for
	  "make it 4k" helped us with the size of this final version. And the 
	  unpacker is now 5 bytes smaller thanks to you, guys! :D
	- Brian Raiter for sstrip.
	- KILE, for his softsynth-related advice :)
	- shash, r3D, isaac2, ethernet and sole, for testing the ports.


 * GREETINGS TO:
	
	biXo, CheeseTea, Collapse, Dreambytes, Dust Inc., Efreet, ethernet, 
	fuzzion, Gum, HardNULL, Lucera, Network, rgba, Software Failure, 
	solstice, Spontz, Stravaganza, TLOTB, xplsv, zona neutra

	(si me he dejado a alguien por saludar, que se de por saludado :P)
