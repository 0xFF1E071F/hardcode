Linux 4k intro for Evoke 2006

just a quick hack made in a few
hours without a real concept ...
don't expect too much :)

requires SDL and accelerated OpenGL
(tested on Intel i915GM / GMA900)

if the sound fucks up (like on the
compo machine :), use the safe version

thanks to
  jk for advice
  gabi for the title :)
