Comments:

Hi! This is our first release. At the time we began to code this intro, we never
thought that we would end up with less than 4096 bytes, but as you see we just
reached 4083 bytes and we don't have anymore ideas what to do :)
Well, we hope you'll enjoy watching this intro in 4k. Just sit back, drink some
beer or coke and look at the fabulous splines made by Juhees.

P.S: A preliminary windows port made in 30 minutes at the party is included.
