                 4k realtime spheremarching with a twist
                           released on Birdie 21


Platform: Linux x86 (is possible to run on x86-64)
Recommended system:
GPU: Nvidia 8800 series or better (ATI/AMD won't work)

Needs: OpenGL (obviously) and SDL


                                IMPORTANT NOTES

This demo uses OSS to output audio. This means (with very few exceptions) that
no other processes will be able to use the sound card while this intro runs.
That is, shut down any application which has the sound card opened for audio
output (mixer applications aren't affected), before starting this intro.

To make sound work with this intro on recent versions of Ubuntu (10.10 and later
I think), use padsp.

The compo version of this intro runs in a variety of resolutions, all 16:9. What
resolutions work well on the compo machine should be tested. Note that resolutions
above and equal to 1280x720 should be reserved for all but the most powerful of
today's graphics cards.

As the binary was compiled on a system with glibc 2.11, this may pose a problem
if you attempt to run it on a system with an older glibc.

Crew: please contact me ASAP if any of this poses any problem for you.
