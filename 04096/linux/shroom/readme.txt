Shroom
4k intro for Assembly 2006

Platform: amd64 linux
Requires: sdl & opengl

Music, coding, effects etc.: Niko Kiirala

Hello demoscene :)
This is my first ever intro shown in public. It took quite a while to
make even this fit in 4k, but I made it eventually. So, it's time for
some shrooms and flowers.
