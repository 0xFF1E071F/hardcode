Recycle - a fast 4k for In√©rcia 2006
by slack/Necrostudios

Proudly   recycling  elements   from  "Boring
noiseprod",  "e-fill",   "katedra",  and,  of
course, the ever-evolving softsynthesizer for
4k intros which sounds worse every day :D

Thanks to inercia  organizers for inviting me
to the  party, to waffle for  telling me that
7zip  can be  a  better gzip  than gzip,  and
shash for  the windows port he'll  perhaps do
in the near future  (although he doesn't know
yet :)

See you!
