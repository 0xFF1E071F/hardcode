SIGGRAPHics in 4k
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a 4k intro by razorbladers (yeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaw!)
released at evoke 10 in 2007


you never thought that this would be possible in 4k... sorry for the long precalc time ;)!


pure party-production

* written in c using auld's 4k-framework (ported to vc++ by rbraz)
* packed with muhmac's 20to4 (i guess i should have used crinkler, though. just because of state-of-the-art-iness)
* curves drawn with .kkkkkkurven (a special almighty tool.. developed just for this production! greeeeeaaaaaat!)

greetings to everybody at the partyplace. especially to place/d-lab42
