You need to change resolution by hand, sorry :(


Story:
It's my and dextero's first intro (new sceners! :)). We developed 90%
of this intro at WeCan party but we failed due to deadline and lack of
glsl knowledge.
Read name of prod backwards ;)


Hardware requirements: pretty good gfx - ray marching is slow
		       and generated code might be too long for some cards (intel).


Special greets for Nitro, maq, Eliot, cahir, Reg, LovelyHannibal, IQ and many others.
And of course many thanks for creators of Crinkler and PuovaHard :)
