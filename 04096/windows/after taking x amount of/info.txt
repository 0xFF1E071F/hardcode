   after taking x amount of various psychoactive substances,
   the world seemed somehow different

   thanks:
   
   shadez/moonhazard for some help
   stonda/matt current for the original name suggestion
      
   
   notes:
   
   this is my first 4k intro after 2 years. no hardware acceleration
   is required because i wanted to do a 1996-like intro (as usual :)).
   
   i was also making a nokia 7210 demo for assembly, but i just couldn't get
   anything that qualifies 'ok' in the short time i had. big thanks to
   dodke, jobe and especially ebr for their effort in the demo project. it
   _will_ be released sometime in the future...
