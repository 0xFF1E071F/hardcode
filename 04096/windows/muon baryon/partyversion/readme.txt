// More Info
 . Ferris here...second released 4k intro for me :) What started as a first
   attempt at Win32 Assembly coding turned out to be one of my favorite
   projects I've ever worked on. It's the first time I've ever felt I was
   pushing the limits of what I was using since back when I was involved in
   the Blitz Basic scene, and I'm quite proud of this...Huge thanks to
   Gargaj and his melodic wonder, which I feel has been a perfect fit for
   these visuals.
 . I always wanted to see a 4k with very coherent design, and since I saw
   Texas on the bigscreen at NVScene, I have yet to come accross this, which
   sickens me. We wanted a multipart 4k with progression, style, and flair,
   and I think all of us have accomplished that here :) .
 . As far as technical information, this intro uses one GLSL shader pair
   that calculates all timers, objects, camera angles, etc. For rendering it
   uses the Sphere Tracing algorithm (or rather, a beaten and pwned version
   of it) to display two objects at a time, but with some clever math alot
   more are achieved. Deformations are spatial, and this little beast also
   can calculate multiple reflection recursions, as well as realtime (NOT
   SCREEN SPACE) ambient occlusion, correct Phong lighting, fog, and also
   some more cute little tricks we're not willing to disclose yet :) .
 . Thanks to Psycho/LNS for his (however brief) explanation of the sphere
   tracing algorithm.
