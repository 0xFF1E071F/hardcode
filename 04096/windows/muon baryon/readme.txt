// More Info
 . Ferris here...second released 4k intro for me :) What started as a first
   attempt at Win32 Assembly coding turned out to be one of my favorite
   projects I've ever worked on. It's the first time I've ever felt I was
   pushing the limits of what I was using since back when I was involved in
   the Blitz Basic scene, and I'm quite proud of this...Huge thanks to
   Gargaj and his melodic wonder, which I feel has been a perfect fit for
   these visuals.
 . I always wanted to see a 4k with very coherent design, and since I saw
   Texas on the bigscreen at NVScene, I have yet to come accross this, which
   sickens me. We wanted a multipart 4k with progression, style, and flair,
   and I think all of us have accomplished that here :) .
 . As far as technical information, this intro uses one GLSL shader pair
   that calculates all timers, objects, camera angles, etc. For rendering it
   uses the Sphere Tracing algorithm (or rather, a beaten and pwned version
   of it) to display two objects at a time, but with some clever math alot
   more are achieved. Deformations are spatial, and this little beast also
   can calculate multiple reflection recursions, as well as realtime (NOT
   SCREEN SPACE) ambient occlusion, correct Phong lighting, fog, and also
   some more cute little tricks we're not willing to disclose yet :) .
 . Thanks to Psycho/LNS for his (however brief) explanation of the sphere
   tracing algorithm.

 . Decipher on the keyboard!  Well, as I write this Mentor is standing
   besides me.  Funny thing this actually turned out to be a fucking
   wonderful collaboration between my mate Jake and me; and what's even
   weirder is, I stayed up 36 hours straight without any sleep to be able to
   at least make my contribution to this intro worthy.  Then I came to
   Assembly (mind you, 600+km) like nothing has happened.
 . I had nothing in mind when I first decided to supply the sauce for the 4k
   but apparently you don't really need anything but some will and luck to
   come up with something.
 . Bah, I am pretty drunk already so I should cut it short.  I am really
   satisfied with this intro and it's always nice to see that we can deliver
   much more than what can be expected from us (Okkie's reaction was
   something along "Wow, you kiddies from Youth Uprising actually
   raymarched in realtime?") :D.
 . Sure this is all nice and stuff, but each and every single one of you
   should know that we're here, and this is just a fraction of what we'll be
   delivering...  Just so you know.
