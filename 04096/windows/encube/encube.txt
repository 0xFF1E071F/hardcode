	4k intro for Alternative Party 2010

 
[credits]
	code, design, music: firebug


[contents]
	this zip contains four versions of the intro. party version
	is exactly the same version as what was run on the screen (so 
	it has the bass sample bug and fixed resolution of 1024x768). 
	the second 4k version has fixed music. the final version has 
	fixed music and resolution selector, so you can view it the 
	way you like. both single- and multi-threaded versions are 
	provided (you don't need to wait for music precalc since it runs
	on different thread).
	
	it's been tested only on ati gpu's.


[notes]
	i'm 23 year old coder from Finland.

	it's my first 4k intro (and demoscene production) ever, so i 
	learned a lot :) unfortunately i didn't test it on a proper 
	sound system before party, and it had *very* much bass.

	i'm also looking for a musician to work with me; throw me a mail 
	at antti.hirvonen[at]gmail.com. i'm also interested in collaborating 
	with other coders to create even more awesome stuff.

	finally note to self: code more before party ;)
