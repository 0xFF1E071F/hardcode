needs a very manly ps2.0 card. thats cos everything gfx-wise is done in some large ps+vs shaders, and
there wasnt much room for things that make it run faster. (it's a 4k, live with it). 
gf6600 or ati x600 or better recommended, welcome to the future. 
tested on a gf6600gt, radeon x800 (both worked perfectly), and a gf5700 (which ran it like shit, but it did work). 

please wait for the precalc at the beginning, it's the usual music generation process.


so. i felt like doing a little 4k - everyone else seems to, so why not join in the fun? =) 
and of course, im too lazy to size optimise my code for hours, so the logical answer is - write as much as possible in shaders.
so you have some 3d all generated in the shader, lighting and shadows, and depth of field postfx.
then i hacked together a synth but i didnt bother making an editor for it, so i made the entire tune in code using tables. 
that's quite a sick process, dont try it at home kids. 


thanks to:

reed and pantaloon for beta testing.
