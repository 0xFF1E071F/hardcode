>> Animated
        Some camera flights where added and the "performance" increased 
        about 20times. Its still not at todays standards.. and if you 
        have a monster gfx card, sorry for the non existing speed. But.
        After rethinking that one as animated entry, i made a few 
        optimizations and added 16 different camera"paths".
        It fits very well to all kind of ambient music, aswell as dubstep 
        and techmospheric, i suppose. now why did I say that. 
        just because there is no music at all :)..

        putted the d3dx41.dll into the archive you can delete it if you 
        have that one already installed.. the compiled version only runs 
        on 1280x720 resolution so if your gfx card doesn't provide this 
        resolution (720p) try to emulate it in the settings, or it 
        wouldn't start, anyhow.. ;)

        perhaps it should be recrinklered for vista and above..

>> About
        These pictures where made around five months before evoke..
        I thought there will be a 4k grafix competition at evoke..
        Sadly there is none :(= . About two weaks ago "patter" was released
        by doom.. till that moment i thought these ones are somewhat well,
        but now i only want to throw them out at some party..

        the 1920x1080 versions didn't run in fullscreen at my desk,
        so i implented them as windowed versions, though they have
        a little delay if you press "esc".
        be aware not to start the 4ks if you have a grafix card with
        less performance than a geforce8 especially the big versions will
        consume major gfx performance and will not be quit that well.
        would be fun to see if someone increases performance/filesize
        by the sources. +please use your own d3dx dlls the ones provided my
        be infected (but very likely aren't)..
