                     Good evening ladies and gentlemen! 

                     We in "STILL" are proud to present another trip 
 
                     through soundscapes and the discovery of the look

                     and motion of some strange places

                     outside the common supernatural universes. 


                     It's a pleasure for us to slow down the timescale

                     of our current world, to process some

                     transmissions at the lhc and some other institutes, 

                     which will show you some of the strange

                     places of the supersubatomical domains.


                     Hopefully you will not get upset by the frequencies
 
                     we captured there. There is plenty of room for

                     improvement in this space. We provided the

                     sources of these pictures to let you know,

                     when these things could happen. Our scientists
 
                     told us not to use normal coding techniques.

                     In fact they said that some demosceners could

                     crunch this into some of the 1k boundaries of space.

                     
                     Almost all information to this dimensional

                     carpets in my room are provided as it is.

                     No animals where (or will be) harmed during

                     this production. But there is the possibility

                     of sensoral displacement and some strange

                     forms of optical hallucinations are reported

                     (also by the coder of this), to not being

                     fully understood. If you see morphing people

                     and/or some people tell you that you morph too

                     slow, we hope it will get better after some

                     sleep or a nice bottle of german brewery.

                     If you don't have the time.. 

                     Please contact us.. Eventually we could help

                     you by reading your letter carefully and

                     provide some information, on how to read morphing

                     letters.. We are still specialists in the field

                     of morphographical debugging.. 

                     And STILL we hope you could somehow enjoy this.

                     We are happy to reach you from some deep

                     places in the demoscene..
 
                     Mad <26.12.2011>.. we love you!
                      
 
                     and thanks to decca for videoencoding & ansi-art...
