                  A 4k intro for Breakpoint 2005



 Will run  with  any  OpenGL compatible  graphics card - tested  on
 an ATI Radeon 9600 pro and a GeForce 4 MX, went fine on both.

 There  is  significant  loading-time  difference  between  AMD and 
 Pentium CPUs. This is due to some floating-point number management
 issues, so the intro loads for ~30 seconds on an AMD and  for more
 than a minute on a Pentium 4.. :(

 The music  is a  result  of a  six-month  development   phase, the
 product  of our  new  4k-synth  called  .kklangzeug.  It  won't be
 publicly  available  yet, as we  do not want  to release  it in an
 unfinished form. The  whole audio-section of  the code takes up at
 most 1100 bytes in the executable, depending on the pack-ratio.

hehe.
tsw thinks i'll leave the readme intact - how naive ;D
thing is that he rox, and i'm not bullshitting here.
his code is GREAT.
seriously.
and no matter how i pestered him about all the little
shit tweaks in the synth gui, it all works now.
the dude wrote a gui that ubers werkkzeug and buzz
AT THE SAME TIME.
so.
why i'm writing this is because all you puny humans
must WORSHIP AND PH33R HIM - in 2 years you'll
be crying over his victories.

consider yourself warned.
