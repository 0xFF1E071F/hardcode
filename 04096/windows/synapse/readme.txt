    4k intro for Payback 2014

    code, visuals, direction: firebug
    music: cce


[contents]
    this zip contains two flavors of the intro, party and final.
    final version has some small fixes that i didn't have time
    to implement before the party. you should watch it, not the 
    party one :)

    synapse.exe implements a resolution selector, so you should
    run it if you require something else than 1080p output.


[firebug's notes]
    my second 4k \o/

    missed friday and saturday morning of the party because had 
    to work on this, so again, note to self: finish prods in advance
    (yeah, like that will ever happen).

    extra special thanks to cce for making the awesome track
    and taking some burden of my shoulders. it was a
    pleasure to work with you.
