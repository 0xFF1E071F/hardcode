GRAPHICS: lunatic
   MUSIC: ddeml

BIG thanks to MUHMAC for helping us to wring out the
last overhead bytes with a dedicated optimization of
his 20to4 tool!

HONESTLY we are NOT proud of this release. :-/

LUNATIC designed a full featured raytracer using
photon tracing and a space partition tree capable to
perform real time lighting, shadow casting, reflection
and refraction. Unfortunately the raytracer was too
large...

NEVERLESESS you see an easter bunny made out of
142.000 (in words onehundredfourtytwothousand)
spheres.

THE MUSIC was originally planned as a remake of CLOSE
TO ME from THE CURE which sounded pretty cool in the
original draft. Unfortunately the music was too
large...

SO YOU SEE a mutilated raytracer with mutilated music.
The good thing: It is easy for us to get better ;)
