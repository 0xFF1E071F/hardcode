	     4k intro by Loonies
	
	Released at Assembly 2007

	Final version: Features text as it was originaly intended, planned, coded, but 
	not optimized in time ;) Oh... and please update your drivers before whining
	about speed issues, ok? :) We might use openGL and other stonage technology, 
	but that doesn't mean you shouldn't update your driver on a regular basis :)



	Credits
	=======
	Visuals Programming and Music by Maytz
	Softsynth and System Setup by Rasmus
	

	Requirements
	============
	PC, Windows, OpenGL 1.1, and a fairly new gfxcard with loads of RAM

	
	Note | Compression á la Crinkler 1.0a, served chilled with a little squeeze of lemon...

	
	(Maytz:)
	Blahh blahh.. ran out of time...loads of excuxes for this intro ;)
	This is my first openGL/C++ code ever, so expect some major improvements in
	future releases. Currently we are working on a (lot) better softhsynth and better code
	structure. And it looks promising :) 
	Well, guess that was it - see ya!
