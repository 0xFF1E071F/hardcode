Greetings and many thanks to Mentor and rest of people
involved in making Crinkler.



The intro has very long loading time. This is mostly due to
compilation of 28 versions of very long pixel shaders, with
which MS compiler seemingly has a lot of problems.


The music for the intro was entirely party-coded (including synth),
so don't expect too much from it.



Have fun,
