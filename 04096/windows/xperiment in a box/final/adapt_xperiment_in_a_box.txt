Greeting to all cool demogroups except the uncool out there.

GPU particle systems implemented with DX9 HLSL effects,
music played by modulo random seed midi music sequencer.

The end result varies a lot from the original concept
(which was made for our asm 2011 64k intro),
and the story of the getting the size down to 4096
included pretty dramatic party coding to be applied.

During the last night before the 4k compo, 
the size was still dropped down from about 4700 bytes
to the limit (this process included a full blown
rewrite of the rocket data player). Without this,
the whole intro would of course be not out as 4k.
