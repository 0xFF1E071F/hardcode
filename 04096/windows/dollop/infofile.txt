Special thanks to Gopher & Powl / Alcatraz for 4klang 
synth and support! Go to http://4klang.untergrund.net

Small size was accomplished by using Crinkler. Big respect 
to Blueberry and Mentor! See http://www.crinkler.net

This stuff is rather heavy on fragment shaders, so we
recommend atleast some higher end 8000-series Nvidia 
GeForce for viewing pleasure. If you get low framerates,
try running the intro on a lower resolution.

Square pixels is assumed for correct aspect ratio.
