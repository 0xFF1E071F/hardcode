  [ RELEASE INFO ]------------------------------------------------------------/

  Our first 4 kilobyte intro. WARNING - CONTAINS FLASHING IMAGES !
  WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL PROBLEMS TO WATCH THE
  SECOND-LAST PART . LOL :)

  Anyway, everything except the font is drawn using code, and not from data.
  Thanks to [sheep]/AGES for the tutorials. They really helped.

  No music because uFMOD just bloats the code up to 10kb compressed. Sorry.
  I'll probably figure it out in the end. :)

                                                                //zorke^nrv

  mail and we'll see what we can do for you. :)
  We mainly specialize in ASCII art and module music , although we are able
  to code some *simple* cracktros.

  Examples of our past work will be available on pouet.net , or just
  mail us at zedd@hushmail.me to request samples.

            * - You don't have to be a *really good* coder. :)
                As long as you can make things like simple chipdisks
                or other things like that then it's ok :D
