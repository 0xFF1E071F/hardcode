	music ................. Tufan 'Sonic' Uysal [TU303Sonic#gmx.net]

				it in time, many thanks to muhmac for help and tips

Requirements:
-------------
	- DirectX 9.0c February Release (with D3DX included as DLL)
	- Pixel Shader 2.0 capable graphics board
	- patience for the pre-calculation ;-)

Contents:
---------
	The zip-file contains two versions of the 4k intro. The party version
	is named 'parsec.bat'. The second version provides more compatibility
	(no xp-specific optimizations, no cab-dropper etc.). The batch file
	writes a file named '.-' to disk... don't worry, you may simply delete 
	it after watching.
