"San Angeles Observation"

4 KB intro

an ARMADA / TRAUMA production

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

Fairly fast OpenGL hardware accelerated graphics card is required. Only
standard OpenGL is used, so there is no need for a specific brand. The
intro is tested mainly on GeForce4 and Radeon 9600XT level and newer
cards.

There is two versions included:
* Angeles-XP.bat is only for Windows XP. Tested to be properly working
  with Windows XP with Service Pack 1. This is the compo version which
  is 4 KB in size (or actually a few bytes less).
* Angeles-SAFE.exe for other Windows flavors, tested to be properly
  working with Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
