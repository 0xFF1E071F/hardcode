KeyJ of Kakiarts presents
with artistic support from SubC and dq
a 2.5k procedural graphics entry:

  "Think inside the box"

Completely made during TUM 2007, using
Crinkler technology by Mentor&Blueberry.

Lacks antialiasing because I suck.

On some systems, you will get continuous
preview, on others, there will be a few
steps visible only.
Did I mention that I suck? :)

Any key quits, but the [S] key
additionally writes a .bmp file to disk.
