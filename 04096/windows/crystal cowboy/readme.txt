:: ABOUT THE GROUP

	BluFlame is a new demo group, founded in 2007.
	The two members are passionate musicians and demoscene enthusiasts:
	
		RaYn: Music
		xTr1m: Code+Gfx+Music
		
:: ABOUT THE PRODUCTION

	Crystal Cowboy is a 4k intro done by xTr1m. It's the first released
	production of BluFlame, and it's the first released intro by xTr1m.
	It uses OpenGL, DirectMusic and no shaders (oh the filesize!).
	Runs great on an Intel Centrino 1,5GHz with an ATi Mobility Radeon 
	9700. Uses about 14MB of RAM. Done with Visual C++ 2005 & crinckler.
	
:: CREDITS

	Many thanks go to las. He gave me the initial help in creating the
	4k codebase, and gave me enough hints to achieve a filesize under 4k
	out of 4881 bytes.
	Cheers to eye for telling me that there's a wonderful thing called
	crinckler! I was having trouble with LoadLibrary already...
	I'm using a glow effect similar to the one in tAAt's Andromedary 4k,
	it was really a great inspiration for me.
	Many thanks to auld for his flow2 article in in4k.net. It's a cool
	insight in how to use GLSL without taking away much space. I wanted 
	to use shaders, but in favor of the small filesize, i sadly decided
	against	it.
