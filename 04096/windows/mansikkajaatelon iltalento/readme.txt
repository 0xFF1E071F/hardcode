 Mansikkojäätelön Iltalento
----------------------------

Slightly less than 4kb intro for Booz^WAssebmly 2016,
production by Teemu 'mystran' Voipio (mystran@gmail.com).

--

Requires Direct3D 9.0c runtime, runs 720p, hopefully.

Developed on Win7 NVidia GTX570, which is probably roughly
the minimum config .. 'cos well, yeah..

Fades to black and silence at end ... to give the used some
time to reflect upon the deeper meaning of life, universe and
strawberry icecream, you can alternatively hit escape to exit.

--

Runs a legit fluid simulation with a bunch of particles for
visualization and some horrible noise as a substitute for music.

GPGPU done hard way using legacy APIs, because why not?
