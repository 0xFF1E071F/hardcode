>> About
        My first try in visualization of some selfcoherent structures provided
        by an modified iterated function system.. It's not written for any
        competition, it's more meant to be an attempt in searching of a good 
        looking formula which isn't stressed to the max already..


>> Suggestions

        Please disable virus software in order to run this,
        it's packed with (awesom)crinkler and will be most probably 
        seen as a virus (which it isn't). 

        Make sure you have a resolution of 1280x720 established for 
        your monitor and gfx card (if not the demo just exits).

        d3dx_41.dll should be installed + soundcard should be in 
        a normal mode. (you could rename the d3dx_42.dll or install the directx 
	redist from feb2010)

        Windows XP32, yet.. and ofcourse first try the compo version..

        I was told that on some computers it causes a bluescreen and hope that
        didn't happen to you.. You could debug it with the provided sources
        if you are a coder by your own..
