Rays and Arrays by lucid

Last moment entry from Boozembly 2009 :)

Basicly, this is programmed in a Lisp-style language,
compiled to some ~2k of bytecode, then run through
a C++ written ~2k interpreter. It's a bit silly that
it's a raytracer, since the system is not good with
CPU-heavy stuff, Working on it. I don't like the
content, but the engine is fun to work with. Sorry
about the soundtrack, again.
