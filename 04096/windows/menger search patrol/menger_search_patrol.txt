[notes]
	It is a quickly made production (~3 evenings and one 
	frustrating morning). In that time you really can't make 
	a decent 4k intro (or at least I can't), but you can 
	probably finish one frame :)

	The last bits of code were written right before deadline, so
	it's not a super polished prod. Doesn't work on NVIDIA as 
	far as I know. Tested on two different ones. I have no 
	interest to debug this any further; try the debug version if 
	you want to help me (I don't have NVIDIA to test on :<).
	
	It's a long time since I coded something like this so the code
	is completely unoptimized and partly horrible, which may have 
	something to do with the prod not working on Nvidia.. :)

	There is a lot of space left (for 4k). The current executable 
	could be propably crunched down under 2kB boundary by rewriting 
	"some" of the code.
