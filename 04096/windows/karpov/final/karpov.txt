	this intro won the kasparov-lookalike-contest.
	it has shorter name and shorter size.
	ranked 4th at mekka/symposium 2k1.
	thanks to the audience for their really cewl live-support. you rock.
	thanks to the organizing for showing it without second keyframe part and bad gamma in the compo.
	thanks to the organizing for showing it again later (nearly noone recognized it. ;)
	
	this is the final, a bit faster and brighter one.
	it doesn't switch to fullscreen 'cause 640*480 already requires really fast equipment (>700MHz, TNT2).
	
	code by pigpen^oCCult in a rush.
	
	50 badly keyframed spiders
	5 textures
	1392 basic objects at all
	2 unbelievable fx samples ;) (time was too short)
