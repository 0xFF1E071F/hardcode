Autumn time is TRSAC time!
You know what they say: Trask til TRSAC.

We are once again having TRSAC, and entirely in keeping with
the usual way of things, it is in the same location as last 
year: sunny Århus, Venice of the eastern seaboard, shining 
beacon of culture and all-round nice place.

Same as last year, the party is being held in the third
weekend of October, which is to say the 22nd to 24th.

If you have any queries, contact us at trsac@trsac.dk. We had
a blast last time, so please - join us for some party fun once
again, at the most bestest and most friendliest chilled-out 
party that used to uses ducks for prizes!
