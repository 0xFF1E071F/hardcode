The intro is highly random and runs forever. If it looks like crap,
let it run a little longer, it might improve. If it sounds like crap,
you're out of luck. This is as good as it gets.

The intro uses Crinkler for compression. So much thanks to you guys from TBC
and loonies for making such an awesome tool!
