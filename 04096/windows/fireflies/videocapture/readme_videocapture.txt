Video Capture Version of Fireflies
----------------------------------

Creates audio and video frame dumps into directory "capture".
Just combine them by any means.

The output resolution is 1280x720 and frames per second is 60.
This will require approximately 5 gigabytes of hard disk space.
Video will be badly out of sync during the capture.

Please be patient at startup since the capture version will
first calculate all wave data.
