20_party.exe is the party version. set to a screen resolution of 1920x1080, using floating point sample buffers and not using crinklers safeimport option.

20_lowres_safe.exe is a 1024x768 version with floating point sample buffers and with safeimport option.

20_lowres_safe_pcm.exe is the same as above, but doesnt use floating point sample buffers (which i think had problems on the compo machine)

a party hack after all :)
