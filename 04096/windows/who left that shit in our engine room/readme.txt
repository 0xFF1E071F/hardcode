Crinkler (1.4) used for compression.


Requirements
============
DirectX 11 graphics card (probably >1gb - large ray buffers)
DirectX Runtime June 2010 installed - OR d3dcompiler_47.dll (faster, included in win 8.1)

Rendertime is 13s on R9 290, so can easily take minutes on slow hardware.

Info
====
Pathtracing with dof, softshadows, fuzzy reflections/refractions and diffuse interreflections.
Scene consists of 75 primtives (cubes, elipsoides, rings), modelled in custom tool.

generate_hires.exe won't show the picture, but save a 3072x1728 png image - after some time.

The name and picture refers to the DUB posters spread all over the party (advertising the 
battle cards) - and Revision's rocket/mothership theme.

Release version is slightly improved/tweaked from original compoversion.

_nvidia version running unoptimized shader code generation to work on at least the gtx860m 
(otherwise at least one of my workarounds for nividia shader compiler bugs is optimized away..)
