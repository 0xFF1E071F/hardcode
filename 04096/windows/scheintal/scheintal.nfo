 @comment
   Minimum PC configuration:

   Well... this intro features a very 
   slow software engine, so you should
   better have a high end CPU, even 
   though memory speed and cache 
   performance is more important.
   The CPU must also support the MMX 
   and the infamous cmovCC 
   instructions, so a PII is the bare 
   minimum, even though I doubt that 
   this runs acceptably on a PC with
   less than 1GHz.

   The graphics card doesn't really 
   matter. It must be able to support 
   256x1024 32Bit textures and a 
   screen resolution of 1024x768 at 
   32Bit. Speed doesn't matter, so it
   should work just perfectly on a 
   TNT-class card (I haven't tested it
   on such a card, though).

   It should run on any Windows version
   with DirectX 8.0 installed. The 
   compo version requires read and write
   access to "C:\". Try running one of 
   the compatible versions if that
   isn't possible.

 @final note
   real coders write software engines
