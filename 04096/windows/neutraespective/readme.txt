>> About

        Why did I use this formula, you ask.. now.. it was
        planned to be a normal mandelbrot rendering 4k. then someone on
        the inet pointed out a new formula (which they got their heads
        on at pouet). I didn't want to use that formula at first and went
        a little dizzy. Now the formula had an interesting look
        so I implemented it onto my old mandelbrot 4k some days ago 
        and left it. Perhaps it's not that impressive but at least it has
        quite an interesting look, even that blocky lighting ;). 
        Perhaps that will improve to a real distance field later...

>> 4k

	I use the effect compiler, and the font routine.. at opengl that
        runs without some extra .dll, but sorry, 
        I like that d3dx stuff.. 
        Music was a fast hack, exported with notebuffer accidentally.

        Please do notice that i initially wanted to do a normal mandelbrot.
        It was never planned that there could appear a new mandelbrot formula
        in the making.

>> Suggestions

        Please disable virus software in order to run this,
        its packed with (awesom)crinkler and will be most probably 
        seen as a virus (which it isn't). 

        Make sure you have a resolution of 1280x720 established for 
        your monitor and gfx card (if not the demo just exits),
        use the windowed version if you don't know how to add resolutions. 

        d3dx_41.dll should be installed + soundcard should be in 
        a normal mode.

        Windows XP32, yet.. 

        so if you choose the no multicore version please wait till 
        the demo starts, even if you could do some other stuff in 
        the meantime, yes the demo works in the background and
        launches (approx 2min) later.. 
        Don't start the demo twice..

        And do compare the size of this file with the actual exe..
