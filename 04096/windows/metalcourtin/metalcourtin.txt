4k contribution to SceneCon 2007 from Archee

 It was finished 8 minutes before the compo, and it lost about 300 bytes during the party:) 
 Thanks to the people, who allowed me to test on their laptops during the party, because mine does not support PS2.0, and it was kind of a "beethowen optimization" of -300 byets, until I got to test.
 I know, it should have been faster, it was a timing big, which I noticed too late.


Hint:
  Precalc time is about 20 sec.PS 2.0 required. You need a fast GPU to run, otherwise you get black screen. At least a Geforce 6600Gt.
