This demo needs a graphics card with pixel shader  --< !

While soundwise it uses pretty much the same engine as rodin the graphics
part follows a completely different approach. What you see is a 3D cut through
the 4D julia fractal. The fractal parameters are modified through the
envelopes used in the sound engine to pretend some sync. All in all it just
took us a week to make this tro.

have fun.
