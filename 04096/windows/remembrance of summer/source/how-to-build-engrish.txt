Requirements :
    . Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

    . Microsoft Platform SDK
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/

    . Crinkler v0.4a
      http://www.crinkler.net/


How to build (with Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition) :
    . Copy "crinkler.exe" as "source/crinkler/crinkler.exe"

    . If you installed Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition or Platform SDK to
      non-default folder, open a batch file "source/crinkler/run-crinkler.bat"
      and change environment variable "PSDKDIR", "VCDIR".

    . Open "source/RemembranceOfSummer.vcproj", select 
      "Build - Configuration manager" and "Final".
      (If you are testing, select "Release")

    . Select "Build - Build Solution" to build a executable file.

    . Select "Debug - Run without Debug".


About code :
    . Very fundamental C++ code.

    . There is no effort to make smaller code. I completely depend
      on crinkler.

    . Music is also able to compile by yourself. Run a batch file
      "source/media/compile-music.bat", then music source file
      "source/media/nada.ppk" will be compiled and you will get a
      output file "source/media/sequence.bin.h". Then copy this
      file as "source/src/sequence.bin.h", and rebuild.
