When I saw the countdown clock display 22 hours remaining,
I knew I had to start and finish this intro by today. I've
finally got together  way  past  my  bed-time  and started
experimenting with a water  effect,  which was my original
idea for the compo  entry.  It  operated  by  displaying a
preset image as it was in  water. It looks great on hi-res
images, but due to size  constraints I was unable to do it
even with scaling as the quality  of low-resolution images
was too bad. Looking at  the  clock, I've  just decided to
throw up together a particle effect I have already done.
Enjoy!
