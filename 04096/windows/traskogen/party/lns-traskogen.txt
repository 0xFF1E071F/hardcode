Loonies present a Windows 4k intro:

Traskogen - TRSAC 2011 Invitation

Mostly made at Outline and Solskogen 2011 ;)

Credits:
Blueberry: Synth, Additional Mentorizing
Maytz: Music
Psycho: The rest

Requirements:
DirectX 11 graphics card - most should do.

Technical:
-Font build of primitives (2-5 per character) for ray marching.
-CPU code assembling primitive lists for the gpu.
-Scene ray marched by compute shader in 16x16 pixel tiles, first building
a list of active primitives for each tile in shared mem for later raymarching pr pixel.
-Oneshot mode of the raymarcher spawning particles to the particle buffer
instead of writing pixels on screen buffer.
-Small and simple particle system (fixed size particles, gravities/groundcollision/turbulence)
-Single pass DOF filter - 30 taps.

(And no... compute shaders using shared onchip memory are not 
easily portable to dx10, and without the tile optimization 
it is way to slow to raymarch that many objects... ;)





Autumn time is TRSAC time!

We are once again having TRSAC, and entirely in keeping with
the usual way of things, it is in the same location as last 
year: sunny Århus, Venice of the eastern seaboard, shining 
beacon of culture and all-round nice place.

Same as last year, the party is being held in the third weekend
of October, which is to say the 21nd to 23th.

If you have any queries, contact us at trsac@trsac.dk. We had
a blast last time, so please - join us for some party fun once
again, at the most bestest and most friendliest chilled-out 
party that used to uses ducks for prizes!
