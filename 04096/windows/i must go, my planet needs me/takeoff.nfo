Takeoff by BoyC

a 4k gfx entry for
Revision 2015

We finished with our 64k earlier than usual
and I missed a good old fashioned deadline
rush so on a whim I started a 4k gfx entry :)
Thanks to Zoom for the final touches, Maugli
for the moral support and the organizers for 
an awesome party!
