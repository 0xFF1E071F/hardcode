     .philosophy

       once again work that has been hacked   together during
       approx. one week. i would like to thank all the
       contributors.

       the aim was to make something with more feeling,  nice
       graphical fx and syncronization since the breakpoint04
       4kb intro failed badly.

       packed with 20to4 executable compressor. for more info
       check http://www.20to4.net - thanks muhmac.

       special thanks to  intel for their pentium 4 floating-
       point denormalization bug. amd rules!

       so if the sound crackles or the graphics arent  smooth
       its probably  caused by  intels fpu design  because it
       it cant handle small floating-point numbers.
