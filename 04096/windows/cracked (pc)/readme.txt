"Cracked (PC)" for ASM'05 4k intro competition by Inphernic
-----------------------------------------------------------

Versions:

- entry		The actual compo entry. It _might_ work on
		other machines (at least WXP SP2).. or not.

- release	This _should_ work on most machines.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

If it fails to start, try launching it from the same drive
your temporary directory is located in. Most likely that
would be C.

This one runs in 640x480x16, windowed or fullscreen.

Done in C, written from scratch. This is my first one ever,
so I'll just greet everyone and your mom. Thanks to Gem for
his exe packer, Dropper.
