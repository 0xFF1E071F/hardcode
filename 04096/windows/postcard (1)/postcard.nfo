A tiny exe graphics remote entry for Sundown 2016.

Software rendered, 1920x1280. SVG paths are crazy shit.

Made with love, caffeine and two nights' worth of sleep deprivation
by the dynamic duo of dojoe (code, graphics) and kaomau (graphics).

Greetings to SunSpire, Slainte, T$, Topy44, ruairi, Steve, Ziphoid,
fizzer, Saga Musix, halcy, LJ and everyone at Sundown! <3

Thanks to Mentor and Blueberry for the magic that is Crinkler, and
to iq for his tiny intro framework!
