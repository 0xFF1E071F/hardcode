The source files are meant to be used with Visual Studio 2005 and a recent DirectX 9 SDK. You also have to have Crinkler 1.1 or later up and running to get a real 4K version with the "Release" and "Release Fast" configurations.

The MIDI files are converted using the "build_audio.bat" batch file in the "tools\bin" folder. For the batch file to work you need a "intermediate" folder at the same level as the "code" and "content" folder.

The source files are lincensed under The MIT License. See "license.txt" for details.

Happy browsing
