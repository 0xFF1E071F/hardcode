Title:                Terrai (unfinished terraiN)
Created by:           Stepanov Andrey, 2008
3D Graphics software: Open GL
Packed by:            Crinkler 1.0a (Jan  7 2007) (c) 2005-2007 Aske Simon Christensen & Rune Stubbe.
                      Crinkler is included in source code project (as link.exe). I hope, it's creators will forgive me :)
Tested on:            Windows 2000, Windows XP, seems not to work on Windows Vista

This is my (obviously failed) attempt to create "relaxing" demo :) Music and graphics are really bad... But maybe
someone will find source code useful. So I release this demo anyway.
