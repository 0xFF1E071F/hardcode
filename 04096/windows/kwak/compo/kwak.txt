	A NON-COMMERCIAL 4K INTRO
	first shown at assembly 2002 in helsinki, finland

	            
                     - champaign is not allowed -

	code by dake
	
	thanks to Rasmus Christian Kaae for the small openGL code
	Gem / Gergely Kutenics for his Dropper util and the famous

	it needs at least a GeForce - first generation will do it. 
	if it doesn't look like beer then suppose it's vodka. 
	don't tweak your speakers, there's no music.
