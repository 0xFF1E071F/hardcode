<< Suggested hardware:

    CPU is much less important here since everything
    runs on the graphicscard.
  
    GeForce8 or some really good ati card is required,
    don't know why equal ati cards seem to be slower,
    should be some driver issue.
    atleast Pixelshader 3.0 is required to run this.


>> Tested on:

    GeForce 8
    GeForce 7600
    HD 3600
