a 4kb intro for Optimise 2002

hacked this together quickly for compo
4kb forever ;)
next time i'll code it better so I can keep the audio in :>
not enough time thesedays to code it all in asm, so this was made in VC

needs windows,opengl1.1 and some luck

sorry for such terrible source..oh well ;P
