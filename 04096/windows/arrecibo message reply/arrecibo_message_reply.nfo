GRAY ALIEN RESISTANCE PRESENTS
    ARRECIBO MESSAGE REPLY
	PC 4K INTRO
   Shown at Revision 2012
-------------------------------
This is my first ever submission to a demoparty. I wrote both visuals and music.
I will try to make a proper final release because i started writing music synth for a first time
15 days before the deadline, so music does not capture the feeling i wanted to give to this intro.

I must credit Akuma Arts and Stefan Gustavson for their simplex noise function (https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise).
Seven/Fulcrum for his tip on windows 7 mouse cursor hiding
Optimus for his "grid tunnel" effect, which 3rd scene of this intro uses as a basis.
And of course iq/rgba for his incredible site.
Crinkler used for compression.
