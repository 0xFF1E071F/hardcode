faktoid
4k Intro by T$
german version released at TUM2002

This intro contains a large amount of 
fake-2D-splinevectorgraphic and nearly no
code at all. Blame cable TV, not me.

Requirements:
-Windows (Win95 requires IE4+ or similar installed
due to missing fonts in Win95)
-DirectDraw (640x480x16)
-DirectSound

Note: After some time the warning screen should be
replaced by a world map and some noise. It may look 
ugly, but should work fine anyway.
