Notes:
 
  - Win32, D3D9 .. uses Crinkler so XP+
  
  - uses auto-detected desktop resolution, assumes pixels are square;
  just set whatever you want first and it should work; there is also
  an alternatively -720p version that is fixed at 1280x720 in case the
  auto-detection proves problematic in some situation..
  
  - loops (single loop is about 2min), loops are basically identical
  and it's fine to exit after it goes back to the chessboard ..
  
  - uses trapezoidal integration at measured framerate, so there can
  be some slight disparencies if the framerate drops too much; should
  not be an issue on any decent gaming or compo system though ..
  
  - should work fine with both AMD and NV .. and probably "runs" even
  on Intel GPUs .. but basically I did the dev on slow AMD laptop and
  then checked on GTX570 that the performance would be acceptable..

 Artistically this is not terribly interesting .. as I had no idea what
 I was actually doing .. so I guess it's mostly a size-coding exercise,
 trying to pack as many details as possibly into the size limit, while
 still doing it as robustly as possible.
  
 So .. yeah .. enjoy .. hopefully it's not totally lame. This is what
 you get when an audio programmer tries to do graphics. :)
 
 If the music sounds familiar, you are probably a shmupper, and might
 have heard the main arp-theme (or well, slight variation) in my beta
 shmup that has been in some public circulation. So this is sort of a
 4k version of one of the game stage tunes I made for that thingie.
 
 At the end though, this was very interesting learning experience on
 what does and doesn't take a lot of space.. so I'll definitely want
 to try again in the future, with everything I've learned here .. :)
