Hi folks out there. Chock hits back with just another fantastic release,
oh well...

Find the hidden text (this is so fucking hard...) and you understand
what this intro is all about. Or maybe not.

This "effect" was actually done for a "serious" release for bp2004. Oh well,
it is very much unfinished, and only funny in the context, so, sorry for the
bad quality.

Optimus, I hope you have a nice real life. And I count the days until
you will be back at pouet. WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!!!

Greets to my friends.
Chock

Dedicated to the (maybe) most famous scener ever.
