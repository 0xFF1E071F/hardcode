what a failure
	by
Ye Olde Laptops Posse

a 4k intro for Tokyo Demo Fest 2012, 13-14.01.2012, Tokyo, Japan

PARTYVERSION

code, "music": w23 (me@w23.ru)

REQ:
	OpenGL 2.1
	rather 2009-2010'ish video card
	Windows / OSX / GNU/Linux 

this is a failure because:
 - i worked for it for a month and it looks like this
 - it contains SPH in 4k and it looks like this
 - it doesn't run on any old laptop (and still looks like it should)
 - it isn't very fast even on a new one, and has only 4096 particles 
 - on linux it requires glut for video (and is not tested!)
 - on osx it requires sdl for sound
 - it has already missed all possible deadlines (even though i spent literally all night tuning it for being at least digestible)
 - it is getting released, so it's pretty much stuck in this sorry state FOREVER
