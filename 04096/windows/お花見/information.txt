お花見 (Ohanami) by Fizzer of Eos and Wayfinder
Special thanks to Takeshi from TOCHKA for providing the name, which means "drinking alcohol party under the Sakura trees".
At the release party (Deadline 2017) the true title could not be shown on the beamslide, because it would cause Partymeister to crash.
Extra special thanks to noby.
