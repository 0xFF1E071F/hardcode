ok:

there are 3 reasons why i release this nonsense: ( or just the most_inofficial_invitro ever ;) )

1. i am drunk!
2. i want you all to visit tUM this year ! ( i did win the 4k-compo last year due to bad entries only ! change that this year! )
3. most important and REAL Reason: i want to be compatible !
 -> so i need your feedback if this works on AMD/ATI at all !

so thanx in advance for help !
 i just have no ATI-card available to test it at all and this intro isn´t that bad, eh ?
  so you have some fun and i get my input/help! -> good deal i´d say!

colors are happily distorted for some reason btw :D

yours most drunk,

c0c00n.

P.S:

i did 2 versions in 2 resolutions each ! ( 4/3 and 16/9 )
all versions just only work with a dualcore-proc or even more than 2 cores ! ( 4klang-on_the_fly-rendering! )

the slowTHEshow-versions should be fluid on sth better than NVIDIA 8800GT,while
the fastANDugly-versions should be fine with just that 8800GTS ! ( i has a demobox! )

have fun ! :)
