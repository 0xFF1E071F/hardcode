    a 4k intro for Assembly 2012
	  by Peisik & TarhaTarha

info:
  code:  cce
  music: noby
  
  The intro should always run at your desktop resolution. 
  This time, we ran out of time instead of bytes. That's progress, eh?
  
thanks:
  Made possible by Crinkler by Mentor & Blueberry, and 4klang by Alcatraz.
  Greets to Approximate, you guys should consider doing 4k intros too.
