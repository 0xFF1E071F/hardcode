a rather compofiller-ish 4k for Sunrise 2011
done mostly at the party by kb

No, this still isn't the first 4K intro from Farbrausch that everyone
is waiting for. Again this is just a quickly made up thing to support 
a small demoparty and to teach myself some stuff. Like, how to raymarch
things and how to slap everything together for a fast 4k intro.

using:
- 4Klang by Alcatraz for the music
- Crinkler by Loonies and TBC for the size
- GLSL Minifier by Ctrl-Alt-Test for the size, too
- some GL binding code copied from Auld because I was too laze to type.
  
thanks and greets fly to:
- pouet's Raymarching Beginners' Thread
- beer drinking Belgians for design ideas (sorry guys, no explosions)
- everyone at Sunrise of course.

Tested on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs because we're just that good.
