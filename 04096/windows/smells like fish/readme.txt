[info]
Axes Denied is a rock band. A nerdy rock band. We also hack computers.
This is what we came up for the Assembly 2004. Hope you like it.
Please make sure you have selected a valid MIDI playback device in
Control Panel/Sound and Multimedia/Audio and also that MIDI is not
muted in the sound card's mixer. Thank you.
