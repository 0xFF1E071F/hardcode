
Hi, it's pohar typing here.

Finally we managed to make a coop prod with Auld.
We were both preparing to make it for a long time.
There is a saying here:
"Hungarian and Polish are two good friends" :)

This morning we have arrived to the end of a long journey.
We've gone through all the usual good and bad times.
Sometimes we almost gave it up, but we have always found
new motivations.

Auld was making small effects all the time, and it was
hard to convince him to make an intro out of it. We decided
that he will make the graphics part, Vincenzo makes the music
and I will make the synth. While Auld was putting the parts together 
he asked me about how much space my synth needs. I've told him to
leave me 2k, but he already filled 3k. At this point we thought
about aiming for Breakpoint's 5k compo :)
We started working on the music with Vincenzo. We had a big boxing 
fight about which parts of the synth could be dropped. After  making
the music and merging it with the intro we were over 4600 bytes.
Noone else believed that it can be shrinked to 4096 - except me .
Even our groupleader m:et, which was quite demoralizing. So I offered
him a bet: If I can make it, he will buy me a Frölunda meal at McDonalds,
if I fail, I'll pay. It gave me a lot of power, I was working on 
compression day and night to make it, just to show the non-believers.
Day-by-day I told him that I already got the drink the french fries and
the hamburger :)
At 4171 Auld also found 100+ bytes, so we could start finetuning from
4038 bytes at last 1 week before the party :)
Sadly our final week was taken away by real life, so I've just
finished the prod on Saturday morning, 12 hours after the party started.
I think we got about 6 hours until deadline. I've realized how late
it is when I got this message:
[09:18] <spenot> pohar bazmeg gyere partyra! ;D
(pohar fuck you come to the party!)

So, I am about to leave. Enjoy our intro, bye!
