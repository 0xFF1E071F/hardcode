             4k Delphi intro is POSSiBLE! /migeel
-------------====================================---------------
              first presented at Syndeecate 2003

coded in Borland Delphi 6 Personal!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
do you think it's impossible  to make a 4k Delphi intro?  i say,
it's possible - the living proof is this little intro!
don't expect  anything perfect.  it's just a 4k Win32 intro made
without assembler (or C).
contains  a special music track stolen  from Final Fantasy.  ok,
ok... it sucks a lot,  but hey... i'm a coder.  i don't know how
to make music.
you think, you can make a better midi tune? send it to me!

maybe,  the next time i'll bring some directdraw stuff cause the
GDI sucks. just have to learn some COM related things.

Surgeon generals warning: Making 4k intros in Delphi seriously
                          damages health.

P.S: Only 256b Delphi intro is iMPOSSiBLE!
     ...but we'll see at next demoparty ;-)

P.S, the second: don't you know something about a hardcore delphi
                 directx tut? i don't mean such big delphix crap,
                 only plain (object free)pascal. yes? contact me!

P.S, for everyone, who thinks, this intro sucks:
     This is just proof-of-concept. I think, this is the first 4k
     Delphi intro ever. on my web, you can find  a tutorial about
     making  4k intros  in Delphi.  I just want to show you, that
     Delphi doesn't suck and is worth of your interest.
