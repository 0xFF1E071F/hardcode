4k Delphi intro is POSSiBLE! /migeel

requires: PC with running Windows, but Wine should be enough (although Linux sucks). Monitors and CPUs are welcome...
Contains special Muzac for your pleasure, so don't forget to turn on your loud-speakers.

coded in: Borland Delphi 6 PE (!)

Warning: Don't try to make 4k intros in Delphi at home!

Now with multi-platform support (runs on Windoze XP).
