4k executable graphics
for Tokyo Demo Fest 2015

Fast-coded (three evenings from scratch) SSE-based software renderer.
Have no time to make it better, sorry!
Rendering time should be under 20 seconds on compomachine.
Esc to exit as usual.
Have a nice party!


Thanks to:
iq for the great lessions and multithreading code,
mentor and blueberry for the awesome crinkler, 
and greetings to all sizecoders.
