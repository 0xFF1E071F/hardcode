Prosopagnosia by MooZ / BlockoS

It's a catchier name than "Failed attempt to
implement Jonathan McCabe's Cyclic Symmetric 
Multi-Scale Turing Patterns in 1KB using OpenGL.

The whole thing was started in late January 2011.
But I never managed to get it below 2218 bytes.
   
Messy source code included. 
The "Debug" and "Release" configurations needs glfw3. 
The "Publish" configurations require Crinkler.
The shader was first compressed with Shader Minifier

Enjoy!
