>> About
        Visualization of the mandelbox formula with several optimizations.
        Look at the source for details. I know it can be optimized for a
        better look especially if you are keen on antialiasing. It's not
        exactly AA which is missing it's more that one optimization looks
        wobbly.. If you think this could be done in 1k, look at the still
        1k "futurism" which features somewhat the same formula..
        

>> Suggestions
       Take the 1280x720 version it's build uppon it.. ;)
       You need some sort of d3dx9_??.dll in order to run this..
       And the desired resolution should be present.
