It is pohar at the keys again. Last time the readme had
such a success, that guys demanded me to write down the
story of the intro again:

Some months ago Mrwb and Vame invited me to Kindergarden,
and I said "yes" in that very moment. As we don't like to
visit a party without a release, we started working on a
4k intro. I've found some drafts in the drawer of a 
recursive extrude engine. Slightly modified and developed
version of one of our old effects was made while I was sick 
for some days and I had to stay at home. But it was a great 
time to make the geometry and some basic 'evolution' of it
with some poor camera movement. I started thinking about 
some kinda coloring/shading. Pasy suggested me to use cubic 
environmental mapping, but we weren't satisfied with the 
result. Then I asked Auld to join the project. It wasn't easy
to convince him again, but he made some fake RGB phong/bump 
mapping shader, (that I fell in love with in the first moment)
and a tunnel effect for the background. Meanwhile he wrote 
an article in his sizecoding blog about a cool looking object 
generating method. He added those Latham objects to the intro 
too, and the whole thing started to get into shape.
It was time for music. I felt like we should make a fast-paced
intro, and the mood of the colorful shader made it so obvious
that we need Goa music. Vincenzo made it really fast, and we
were satisfied with the first version of the music (as usual).
I've decided to not use the earlier compressed (I mean: hacked)
version of the synth used in our previous prod (Spheres dream).
So, the first version of the assembled intro was over 
4500 bytes. I offered a bet to M:et again, but he refused it:)
We still had at least 3 weeks 'till the party, so I slowly and
easily took it down to 4300 and then 4100. I didn't have too
much free time to do it due to real-life, but I've spent
some hours with it almost every night. When I've reached 4080
we felt like "We did it!", and we thought we will make some
final touch in the synching/camera movement. But the 
compression didn't stop somehow, and we were approaching 4000.
(I've forget to mention that by this time we were already using
a version tracking system, which made our work with Auld much
easier and faster.)
But then something happened: he had a half sentence: "It would
be cool to add one more shader, but it needs at least 200 bytes"
I didn't need anything more, I've just told him: "start working
on it, and I will make some space".
He didn't know it but when someone says me:"You can't do that",
it gives me wings. A similar sentence made me create my very
first intro back in '99...
So, by removing some unused parts, optimizing program blocks and
music data we were even under 3900 bytes. So, when we added the
distorsion post effect shader we were still almost inside 4k!
Then the experimenting and anti-scientific part of compression
started: I started swappig lines of code, changing variable types,
etc.. Auld also made some simplification, so we had some 50-60 
free bytes again. I felt like we came to the end, but not Auld :)
He managed to add a caleidoscope shader too. I still don't know
how he did that. Then he rearranged the various parts and their
combination with shader, synched to the bassdrum. Now it really
looks like an intro. Our environment (both sceners and real life)
is also satisfied with it, just like us!

Some days earlier we had a bad feeling about the intro is not
compatible with Vista, but Pasy tested it, and everything was fine
with his Gef8600GTS and the beta drivers of Crysis demo version.

As I am writing this boring textfile, we still have about 5 days
'till the party and about 16 bytes left. I am really afraid of
drunken vikings at the party, so I won't do any partycoding :)
To tell you the truth we still don't have a title idea - it will
be added later.

If you are still not bored enough, I will wrote some more lines:
It was our second cooperation with Auld. We were following each
others' intros for almost ages, so I was very happy when we 
finally tried to make something together. Our first intro has got 
a lot of positive feedbacks, that made us very happy. We weren't
even sad about the 2nd place at Function '07, because the winner
1k intro (Tracie) was soo awesome.

What's about the future? I plan to not work on a new intro, but
developing the softsynth, because it is getting old, messy and 
rusty. Not to mention that I've lost the sources of a working
version of the editor with GUI. So we are using an old version
of the editor with a working intro player code :) And the worst
thing is only Vicenzo is able (willing :)) to use the tool,
because it is really weird in some points. Anyway I liked this
one, because it might not be the smallest or the best, but it
had really a unique sound, which enabled us to create various tracks.
The new one will (must) be really user friendly and easy to learn
for any musician. And I hope after finishing it, I'll find someone
who will use it in his intro :)

That's all for now, I hope you'll like this intro (which is
actually smaller than this readme file ).
