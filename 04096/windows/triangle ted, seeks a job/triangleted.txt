Triangle Ted wanted a new 
challenge in life: a new job!
Sick of being like millions 
of others, he set off to find 
new employ.
But the world had changed, 
0 polys, and shaders were 
wanted everywhere. 
His interviewers thought Ted 
was too old (school) to fit in. 
He is too edgy, a little linear 
in his approach, they said. 
Although Ted tried hard to 
transform himself, his true 
colours always came through and 
he was rejected at each interview. 

But Ted struggles on. He stays 
determined and hopeful. 
He knew deep down that these new 
shader guys need triangles to survive. 
Finally, his he finds a place where 
other triangles work.He fits perfectly, 
they need him and he can be himself.

Auld on the mike:
I got to the end with my job last year.
Trying to change jobs made me feel real 
oldskool for half a year. This 4k is the
result. The jerking synch represents how
I felt in interviews, the triangle is me 
of course, the shaders my interviewers.
This 4k is a joint with s!p and 
may be the first to squeeze in a
dialog box so you can tune performance.

Oh and yeah I got a job.
Turned out I got more than one.
Like buses-never one when you need one
then three turn up.
