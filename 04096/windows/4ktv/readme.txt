Some of the startup code based on iq's 1k/4k framework (thanks!). 
Also, thanks to noby's github page for pointing me to iq's framework and all the tools mentioned above. Probably would have never gotten into sizecoding had I not found out about all this info :)

----------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
----------------------------------------------------------

Recommended GPU - Nvidia GTX 670 or better. Not tested on AMD (let me know if it doesn't work).

Run the 1080p version unless your screen resolution is actually lower than that. Demo gets letterboxed otherwise which makes the tv frame look weird (couldn't figure out how to turn this off).
