 		4kb intro
 	
 	code : nufan
 	
 	This little 4k intro was coded on one lonely
 	morning in C++ and I hate it that there is
 	no 4k competition at this years TP, thus I
 	had to release it without a compo, doesn't
 	matter, wouldn't have won anything anyway.
 	
 	About the intro, works nice here on my GF3,
 	didn't test it on other configurations, but
 	it is probably quite slow, since this is my
	first 4k intro ever and I didn't put too much
	work into it.
