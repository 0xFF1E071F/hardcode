Don't distribute without crediting me, iq and Loonies. Otherwise, do whatever the fuck you want with it, but remember that party submissions and demos should be *original* work, so if you just remix it, post it up as a The Signal Remix or something. Just don't be a dick about it all, yeah? Do good things for the scene.
