Changes:
--------
	- fixed gfx card compatibility problem (hopefully)
	- fixed sound bug within fpu misalignment
	- added 64mb and 128mb gfx card versions
	- soundtrack drumline changed from techno to breakbeat

	note:
		- use Direct3D retail mode
		- needs 1.x pixel shader capability
		- try using 64mb versions, if you have low video memory


Contents:
---------
	There are 2 final versions. One for 64mb graphic cards and one for 128mb
	graphic cards. Each of this versions are using 1024x748 32bit screenmode.
	If you want to try out other resolutions, you can change in an directory
	reflecting your cards onboard memory and choose an additional resolution.

	Due to the fact that 4k intros needs some tricky stuff, you need to delete
	the generated "T.exe" everytime you start another "mojo dreams" version.

	The generated "T.exe" is an unpacked version of the intro and is written
	write protected to the directory where the intro is called. Thus, every
	"T.exe" can be deleted without troubles and is neither a backdoor nor a
	virus.
