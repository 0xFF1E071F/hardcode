>> About:

    This 4k was about 4 months on my harddisc. It was an attempt of
    porting my "famous" 4k borg for todays shader technology. It
    consists of two shaders doing raymarching on the gpu. Sadly
    for me I haven't chosen to be at nvision, but i preferably would,
    because there is some part in the intro which could really kick
    on that screen..

<< Suggested hardware:

    CPU is much less important here since everything
    runs on the graphicscard.
  
    GeForce8 or some really good ati card is required,
    don't know why equal ati cards seem to be slower,
    should be some driver issue.
    atleast Pixelshader 3.0 is required to run this.


>> Tested on:

    GeForce 8
    GeForce 7600
    HD 3600
