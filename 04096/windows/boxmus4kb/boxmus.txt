---> bypass 4kb entry for mekkasymposium 2002 <----

everything was made in one day (1) at warps place in
dresden. the intro needs a fast opengl graphics card
and a decent general midi compatible sound card.  
it was tested to work under windows 2000. if it does
not work on your windows version, please try windows
2000.

all code done by rasmus christian kaae.
