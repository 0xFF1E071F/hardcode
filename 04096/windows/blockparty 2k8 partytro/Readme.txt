
	Blockparty 2k8 Partytro

As the name suggests, this was entirely coded at the party place.
It's a 4k intro, featuring no sound, no design, and horrible code.
I was originally planning on releasing a PSP demo, but my computer
recently gave up the ghost, and my entire engine is now spread out
among thousands of chunk files on a corrupted drive. Any tips on
data recovery are welcome.

Greetings fly out to Trailer Park Demos, Northern Dragons, Coolphat,
and all the cool people I've met this year at Blockparty. Looking
forward to a greeat party next year as well! (And NVScene too :-) )
