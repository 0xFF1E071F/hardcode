a 4k intro by bassplace/d-lab42
released at breakpoint 05


http://www.d-lab42.de
bassplace@d-lab42.com


finished on 26/03/05 at the partyplace.

tested on a 1.5 ghz centrino laptop with an ati mobility
radeon 9700 (64 mb) and 512 mb ram.


written in c using the dev-cpp ide with mingw, a windows
port of gcc. final compression and packing with 20to4 by
muhmac (big thanks here).

the basis of this 4k is a small virtual machine with an
own instruction set and 256 float registers. the instruction
set is optimised on opengl-calls and basic math routines.
all the different scenes are scripted in a special small
language that is parsed in realtime later on.
to provide a little bit of music a softsynth is implemented
which has common oscillators to generate the (sucky ;)
synthlines.

enjoy.

cheers,
