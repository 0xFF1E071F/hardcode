
Kraken, a 4k intro for Buenzli 2008 - My first one!

Thanks to iq and Northern Dragons for releasing their 4k frameworks, I wouldn't have gone anywhere without them!
And props to Mentor/TBC and Blueberry/Loonies for Crinkler of course, that's an amazing piece of software.

The contrast has been cranked up for the big screen, so lower yours if it's too bright.
