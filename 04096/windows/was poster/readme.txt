Requirements
============
DirectX 11 graphics card (and maybe not too slow to avoid time outs)
DirectX Runtime June 2010 installed.


Info
====
86 metaballs, 9 metacubes for the hand object (custom modeller this time - don't use blender ;)
Rest distance function modelled.
Raymarched, a bit more samples for the ao, and some cheating with the meta object.
Text texture from a dx9 context...  (yes, could maybe have done the whole shit in dx9)
Lots of noise and seed tweaking..

Some inspiration from the SAW movie posters, combined with a well known german party meme..

generate_hires.exe won't show the picture, but save a 2304*3240 supersampled png image - after some time.
