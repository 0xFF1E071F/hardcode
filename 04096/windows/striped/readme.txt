This is zworp's first intro so that was exciting!
Didn't have much of a plan, mostly just played around with SDFs.

Developed on Windows10 and a GTX970, and will likely not run well on anything slower.
Run striped_720p.exe unless you're from the future.

Tools used:
	* 4klang
	* IQ's 1k/4k framework
	* Crinkler
	* GLSLX shader minifier

Youtube version should be available at https://youtu.be/wkk0bW-opUA after the party.
