Note To Organizers:

Thank you for organizing yet another demo party!  
We hope you enjoy our production, a lot of work has gone into it.

Two things:
1) Music – please ensure that the speakers are on, as the production has great music.
2) Version – there is a compo version, but in the event it does not run, please run: ND_Etherium_good.com     Both version do not have names.  The compo version is tuned for a geforce 4 or similar card.

Cheers to another demo party!!!
Sincerest respect and greets!
The Northern Dragons
