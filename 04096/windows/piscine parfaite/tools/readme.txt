obfusk.exe is a shader source obfuscator and minifier by Archee

Inputs the shader file named shaders.fx, reads reserveds.txt, and outputs some files.
Use the output dictionary.txt to find out what's missing from reserveds.txt
Removes comments and unnecessary characters too. Does not read back dictionary.txt
