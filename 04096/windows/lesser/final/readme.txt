// Lesser by Youth Uprising (Final version)
   - Created for the DBF Interactive Magnification Challenge
 . Framework, Visuals, Design, Synth, Music:
    * Ferris * - [ jaketaylor123(at)hotmail(dot)com ]

// Minimum Specs
 . Decent GFX card with PS4.0 support (GF8600/equivalent/better recommended)
   (for those machines that don't meet this requirement, a video version is
    also available from http://thygrion.untergrund.net/)
 . Also, this is *NOT* guaranteed to work on ATI cards. GLSL conventions were
   followed to the best of my knowledge, but in the end, it was coded on
   NVidia hardware, which follows the GLSL specs about as closely as the North
   Pole is to Antarctica :P

// Tools Used
 . Notepad++
 . NASM
 . Sonant (my 4k synth)
 . Crinkler 1.1a

// More Info
 . Ferris here...first released 4k intro for me :) first time I've entered
   one of these challenges in awhile...the intro turned out nice, hope you
   like it :)
 . The visuals were relatively simple. Implicit surfaces make up all of the
   "objects" displayed here. Add some subtractive blending, mellow colors,
   and unique spatial deformations, and voila :) The rest was just up to the
   camera and soundtrack to carry the mood.
 . Most of this was done in the last couple days before the deadline. Why?
   I guess I just seem to love the pressure and excitement of working so
   close to the finish :D Just my thing, I suppose.
 . Final released for some speed rivisions and also to include an unpacked
   version for win7 and whatnot. Also the music was finalized a bit (since
   the original version, detune was added to Sonant so I took advantage of
   it).
