|    io was originally presented at the pilgrimage demo    |
|    party in 2004.  s_tec wrote the visuals in a great    |
|    hurry a few days before the party, leaving no time    |
|    to polish or add music.  at the party place, s_tec    |
|    showed the unfinished intro to thom, who agreed to    |
|    write a sound track.  while s_tec quickly hacked a    |
|    music player into the intro, thom composed a score    |
|    on paper. neither thom nor s_tec had any idea what    |
|    the music would sound like until 1 hour before the    |
|    deadline, but it was too late make changes at that    |
|    point. the end result was a low-quality intro with    |
|    400 bytes of unused space.                            |
|                                                          |
|    because the party version was so awful, this final    |
|    version is fully reworked. the music is completely    |
|    new, the scene geometry is expanded, and the whole    |
|    camera path is tweaked to perfection. please enjoy    |
|    the improvements, and thank you for watching io.      |
