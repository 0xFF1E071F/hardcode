=> Dreams by: Patton / Zaïebanï (10-Apr-2003)
   a 4kb accelerated intro with synthesized music

=> sys.req.
   *ZX Spectrum +48k running approx. at 1GHz
    (for heavy realtime RGBA plasma & object calculations)
   *final cartridge III with 128mb extended memory
    (for fast & smooth initializing and pre-calculating)
   *ultra-fat agnus with 32mb on board
    (cause this intro is opengl accelerated)
   *and some headphones would be nice
    (cause this intro has a mamojebïc(tm) tune)

=> greets.(this time only international & extraterrestrial).

=> very very important note:
   this is my second "2 days production" intro,
   so don't expect to see anything special in 32768 bits
