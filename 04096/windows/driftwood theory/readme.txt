Credits: All by Lasse Toimela (e-mail: lasse.toimela@cs.helsinki.fi)
Thanks: ircnet #javacafe and #opengl people, 20to4 packer creator dude (9 to 4 is good too!)

Two versions of the same stuff included:
Driftwood.bat - the compo entry, works only with windows XP
DriftwoodUncomp.exe - the uncompressed version, should work if the other version doesn't

Requirements: Win XP on a 1.5ghz computer with a decent gfx card

Until next time, 

Lasse
