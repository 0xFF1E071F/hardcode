Evil Helicopters Attack With Bombs
For NVision 2008

This is my first PC prod and 4k. Most of the code which
is included in this release was coded the 22th August,
though I had put off over 10 days to do it.



Breaks the comporule about writing to the disk and not cleaning up.
I doubt it would win anyway :)

Requires no shaders, but a pretty powerful CPU.

It was a really fun way to learn things,
so I doubt this is going to be my last 4k! :)
