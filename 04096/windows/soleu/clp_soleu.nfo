      ORIGINAL COMMENTS
     -------------------
    
      shash: It's 9:35 in the morning, I have an open beer by my side,
             and as usual at Revision, we pulled an all nigther to get
             this into 4k. But this time is not an intro done in a few
             days to get something at the big screen. After last year, 
             I wanted to do a 4k with better lighting, and to push 
             myself to the limit. So... this started as research into 
             brutalist architecture, as there's a lot of interesting 
             stuff that can be replicated in 4k. I also wanted light 
             to be a central part of the prod. Any way, this is what 
             I got done, which I think fulfills what I wanted to do.
             All this would not have been possible without the help of
             Merry, with whom I mailed extensively discussing GI, 
             raymarching, and general graphics related stuff. Thanks
             mate, for all the interesting mail threads! It was also
             pivotal the input in all things related to architecture,
             construction materials and design, by Itziar. And obviously
             thanks for your patience while I devoted too much time in 
             this. So, here it is, two months of work, in two minutes. 
             Enjoy it, it's been an awesome ride :)
                BTW, this intro was 5.2kb five days ago!
             
      slack: These have been the hardest last 10 bytes ever. I hope
             people will like it. I'm tired. ZZZZzzzz.
      
        Enjoy more,
