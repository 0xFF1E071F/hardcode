Neuron

a quickly made 4k intro presented to you by TBC and Loonies

Puryx: Music
Mentor: Effects, additional engine
Blueberry: Engine, synth, Tool

Requirements:
- DirectX runtime (d3dx9_24.dll)
- Shader model 2.0 or better
- A powerful CPU
- Decent fill rate (lots of alpha blending going on)

The intro reads its resolution from the filename,
so if your preferred resolution is not listed, just
rename the executable accordingly. The intro assumes
a 16:9 aspect, so 1280x1024 might look a bit weird...
