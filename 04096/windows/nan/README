a 4k intro for Evoke 2012 (4th place)

opengl, glsl
sph, raymarching, very simple custom softsynth

code: w23 (me@w23.ru)
http://yolp.omgwtf.ru/

20.08.2012
final version:
 - works on nvidia
 - builds for linux and osx
 - simulation capped @ 20fps (to produce stable results)
 - mousecursor fixed (thx 2 guys in http://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=8720)
 - slightly edited timing and scenes

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - may not work on Linux running under VirtualBox -- seems to be GL glue/driver issue
   win32 / VirtualBox works just fine
 - there still could be some cases of particles disappearance (mostly on nvidia).
   please email me if you can reproduce this situation
