This is what happens when you finish your 4k one day before the party begins and sit in front of your code in a drunken state.
That's right, a flight simulator. Enjoy the motion-sickness and unintuitive navigation! This is how you control the "plane":

   _
 _|W|_
|A|S|D|     With these keys you can change the position of the plane: Up, left, down, right

   _
  |-|
  |_|
  | |       You can increment and decrement the speed using the +/- keys.

 |##|  |    Drag the mouse with the left button to change the direction of flight.
 |##|  |    Don't try to find an intuitive way of flying, this is not at all correctly coded.
