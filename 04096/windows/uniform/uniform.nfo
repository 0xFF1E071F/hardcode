            4k intro by headcrash
               at assembly 2oo5


  one day hack. one effect.

  this intro needs an opengl 1.5 (or higher)
  compliant video card supporting GLSL.
  you may think this sucks, indeed it does.
  basically everything in this intro is done
  on the gpu for the simple reason, that it
  results in compact code. you know, there's
  that 4096b limit...
