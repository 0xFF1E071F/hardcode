After some health issues, and a long stay
at the hospital, this is my "comeback".
A small, poorly coded effect, done in
just under 4 hours =)

Don't mind the few glaring glitches.

Also, note that the speed is directly
proportional to the performance of the
computer on which it is run, as I was
too lazy to clock it.
