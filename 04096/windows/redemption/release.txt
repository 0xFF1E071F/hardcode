Greets to everyone. Why be selective.
Extra thanks to Spookysys for special drunken debugging,
Kusma for saving the day, and alge for assembly input.

As expected, the 4K compo at TG04 went awol,
and thus we released this intro in the 64K
compo instead. It propbably would've been a
lot more pretty as a 4K. :)
