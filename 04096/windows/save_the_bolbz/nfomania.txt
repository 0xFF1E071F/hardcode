we are lame - we ran out of spacetime >> partyversion as always - who carez

the walking cube is our tribute to the legendary a500 demo 
'technological death' by mad elks

sysreq: opengl, soundcard, memory, pentium 3 class cpu, windoze (xp,2k,98?)
it may be slow on your system, or even not run >> again, who carez?

(*) notice that the apack v0.99b we used is a dos .com packer, 
    while this is a native windows executable... :)
    in fact we wrote our own packer but apack was better by about
    150 bytes. 150 bytes difference is fucking important as you know...

for the nontechnical people: 4k means that about 150000 such little 
multimedia stuff like this could be stored (in theory) on a single 74min cd!!
in theory since there hardly exist 150000 such...
