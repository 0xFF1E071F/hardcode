4k Intro coded by T$ for MS 2000

Requires DirectX (DirectSound + DirectDraw 320*200*32)

Use the 640x480 version if your card does not support 320*200 in 32bit
(like the shitty newer drivers from nVidia)

Contains about 2.5 k of not really finished code,
due to 512k PE-Alignment.

The intro does not end by itself - just press ALT - F4
or any other of the common methods of quitting a windowing app.
