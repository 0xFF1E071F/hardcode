YES! AUTUMN TIME IS TRSAC TIME!


We are once again having TRSAC, and entirely in keeping with
the usual way of things, it is in a new location this time:
sunny Aarhus, Venice of the eastern seaboard, shining beacon
of culture and all-round nice place.

TRSAC started out as an objection to The Party becoming too
non-scenish around 2000 (way before that, actually - but around
there was the last straw!) - and it's still going strong! Come
join the fun at TRSAC - organized *by* active sceners *for*
active sceners (well... inactive sceners are welcome too ;) ). 


Just like last year, we are having the party in the third
weekend of October: 16th to 18th of October to be exact. The
location is Aarhus, central Jutland, Denmark - easy to reach by
car, plane, train and ferry. So basically you have no excuse
for not joining us in yet another celebration of the demoscene
and of pepper schnapps.
