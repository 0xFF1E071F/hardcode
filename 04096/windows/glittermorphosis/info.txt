 * uses OpenGL but doesn't use framebuffer objects (to make the coder smaller), and still uses more than 8 bits for additive blending accumulation
 * uses depth-of-field bokeh, motion blur, bloom, flares, and tonemapping
 * both front and back bokeh (according to spherical lens theory) are displayed, for a hexagonal and slightly circular aperture
 * particles are anti-aliased
 * final output is dithered
