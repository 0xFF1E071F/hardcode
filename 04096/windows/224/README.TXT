Some words from the authors:
--------------------------------
This intro was coded by me (Shadow) as a test, just to see if it was possible
to write a 4k windows OpenGL intro with sound and a little texture generator aswell,
all witout writing one single line of assembler. 
Well, it turned out it was possible, ofcourse not much effects in this rather short 
intro, but still, all written in VC6 pure C.

Anyway, other programs used (for compression etc.):
Dropper v1.1 by Gergely Kutenich
UPX 1.05w by Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer & Laszlo Molnar
