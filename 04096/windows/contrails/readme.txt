Code+Music by Sam "Subi" Brown
Art by Ramon B5

Uses 4Klang softsynth (http://4klang.untergrund.net/) by Dominik
´Gopher´ Ries and Paul ´pOWL´ Kraus of Alcatraz.  Thanks for the fast
help!

Uses Crinkler EXE compressor (http://www.crinkler.net/) by Rune L. H.
Stubbe (Mentor/TBC) and Aske Simon Christensen (Blueberry/Loonies).

Also, as this is my first attempt at a 4K intro, the contents of the
IN4K wiki (http://in4k.untergrund.net/) were absolutely vital.
Particularly "To The Road of Ribbon" by Auld and "Andromedary" by XZM
& tAAt.



PLAY IT LOUD, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.

Thank you.
