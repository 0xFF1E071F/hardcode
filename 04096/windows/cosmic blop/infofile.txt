blah   the code was done by ript., and the tune was written by steve.   blah

blah   you _might_ be interested to know that the tune was originally   blah
blah   a .mod written by steve/disasterarea some time in the distant    blah
blah   past, possibly 93 or 94, when disasterarea didn't exist, and     blah
blah   when we were just wee lads, but it was never finished.           blah

blah   speaking of evil midi, you should probably crank up your midi    blah
blah   slider in your windoze mixer to be able to hear the sound.       blah
blah                                                                    blah
blah   it doesn't sound too bad using win2k's midi synth crap.          blah
blah                                                                    blah
blah   dunno what it would sound like in winxp or winme, but            blah
blah   hopefully pretty similar.                                        blah
blah                                                                    blah
blah   unfortunately, i only have this one laptop for testing at this   blah
blah   point in time. that's why the display updates at 60hz.           blah
blah                                                                    blah
blah   it also means that i dunno how many megahertz you need. it       blah
blah   apparently worked fine on a 650mhz with xp ... but that doesn't  blah
blah   tell you much.                                                   blah

blah   i certainly think it would run on quite a lot less.              blah

blah   regardless, if you're not fast enough, it won't run right.       blah
