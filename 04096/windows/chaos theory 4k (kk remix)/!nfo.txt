Original 64k idea                      Conspiracy
Hard work remixing it all in 4k        KK




Hardware requirements:	SM 4.0-class card and A LOT of shader power
			GTX 280 or higher strongly recommended
			good CPU won't hurt (a lot of 3D primitives)
			if you have something slower, consider
			running demo in reduced resolution
			(or waiting for capture)

Known bugs:		Esc key may not work under some Win7 installs
			(Alt+Ctrl+Del to the rescue).



Special thanks go to Marta for her patience.


Many thanks to Mentor, Blueberry and all the people involved in making of Crinkler.

Respect to Conspiracy crew for making one of the best 64ks out there.

	you, for wasting your time reading this all



Some technical details for those interrested:
	The intro is based on set of crazy vertex and pixel shaders.
	Vertex shader deforms and positions all objects. Pixel
	shader shades and renders procedural textures. Before each
	batch of objects there is option to change render states
	and copy current backbuffer to one of the two "rendertarget" textures.
	The trick to fit all shaders was to use extra preprocessor, which
	inlines chunks of text, so they may be nested and reused.
	Custom HLSL parser with intelligent variable renamer was of great help, too.
	Every scene is defined by 3 bytes: duration, 8-bit camera path seed and 8 one-bit flags.
	For further details just disassemble the intro or simply email me at the address below.




Have fun,
KK of DMA
