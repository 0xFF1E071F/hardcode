        Boom. As far as I know, this is the first real Windows intro. As
        even  smaller  Windows programs' size are about 100 kilobytes or
        over,  it seems quite a freaky stuff, don't it?;) It was created
        in four days, in a real hurry.

        You  should disable the screen saver before launching the intro.
        For  a  larger  window size you may also want to set the Windows
        display to 640x480 (with true color or at least hicolor).

        It may happen that I'll put together a DOS version, too. It will
        be  probably smaller than this, but it will be VESA-addicted and
        able to run in 640x480 32bits/pixel mode only.

        The  intro  works  in  640x400  true color (32 bits) internally.
        However, it's not slow at all. It was coded on a p100, actually.
        The source is in pure assembly and compiled with TASM32. All the
        effects   are   drawn   with   non-recursive   raytracing.   The
        blob-plasma effect uses quad adders.
