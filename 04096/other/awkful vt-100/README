AWKful VT-100

This 4k intro is released at party Funcition 03. It is intended to be
run on a 486 laptop connected to an Amiga 2000 on 10 Mbit lan, where
the Amiga has a vt-100 compatible telnet client connecting to the
intro. 

All efects are written in awk. You will also need (common) *NIX tools
to run the intro:
 A *nix system with:
  - sleep
  - netcat (with -e support)
  - /bin/true
  - /bin/bash (or /bin/sh)
  - awk interpreter (tested with mawk)
  - a telnet client is required to take adventage of the networking 
    features of the script ;)

Each delay depends on the CPU speed. Run it on a 486 or change the constants
in the delay loops. It's a partycode...
