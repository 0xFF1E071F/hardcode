FyR/iMAGE! made a 2k intro and so did Sentinel/Infuse...
We figured one 4k intro'd be much more fun, so here you have it...

It might be slow on dx2 machines, but that's because neither of us felt
like timing this thing...

FyR/iMAGE! -> fyr@pi.net
Sentinel/Infuse -> v962887@si.hhs.nl

Have fun everyone!
