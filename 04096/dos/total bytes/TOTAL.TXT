
      Just few words... Works with clean-boot, also tested with
      other configurations like with QEMM and it worked fine. We
      recommend fast (66 MHz) 486 with LB VGA-adapter. Requires VGA
      and at least 80386 processor as you propably knew. This isn't
      designed for 386 computers, because competion computer was 
      486 with new features.


      Thanx for TaskMaster/Gollum and Mikko Lehtinen for loaning
      their 486 computers at the party place.


      We don't want there any modifications by any Personal Creation
      members! We don't want any advertisements from Petteri Kankaro
      and The Black Hole (TBH) texts. Those are BULLSHIT!
