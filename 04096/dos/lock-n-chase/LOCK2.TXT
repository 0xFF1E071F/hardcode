This is just a little lock-n-chase clone I made one day cause I was bored.
Press Space to start, the arrow keys control the movement.  Pressing the space
bar during play will create a lock behind you, good for stopping the mean cops
chasing you around.  The object is to get all the bars on the board, and escape.
 the game is still kinda buggy, but it is playable.
