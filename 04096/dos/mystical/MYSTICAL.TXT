This was my contribution to the 4kb compo, my first production ever.

It was built from different code pieces i wrote in tasm for fun.
I simply glued the best pieces of code together in a hurry and mystical
indeed was the result. After all, it takes only 2.5 kb _uncompressed_.

I'm not too proud of the result (and the voters seemed to agree,
but maybe my  next produ will be better (when I learn to code :-) ). 
Fractal stuff is pentium optimized and you should have 256kb ram free 
You DO have to have it , believe me... :)
