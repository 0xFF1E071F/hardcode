Hi People
Well, this was my silly little contribution for the 4k-intro-competition at
MEKKA '96. Don't expect too much 'cause I've been learning ASM for 3 months.
I sat the whole last night over my sourcecode trying to find out what I exactly
did... Well, here's the official source code release, I tried to comment it as
much as possible, if you have any questions though or want to talk a bit write
me. I'm happy about _every_ new contact, I don't know so many other scene guys.

Something I have to say:
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THIS LITTLE PROGGY DOES TO YOUR COMPUTER.

PLEASE SPREAD THIS SOURCECODE UNMODIFIED. THIS MAY BE SPREAD FREELY AS LONG AS
NO MONEY IS CHARGED,E.G. ON CDROM (EXCEPT YOU HAVE MY EXCLUSIVE PERMISSION TO 
DO SO).

And here's the most important one:
  D A   G R E E T I N G S:

Group greets: RESISTANCE, TC, MASQUE, POSITRON... 
Personal greets: MLF, HILANDER, SUSI H., CROOKS(hi 00fox...),PEOPLE OF KAOZ BBS
