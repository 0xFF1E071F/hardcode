 I suck - The very first 4bk intro from Braindead Software, made by
 Mentat.
  As named, the intro sucks :), but it truly IS the first intro from
 us...

  ISUCK was not-so-proudly coded in Assembly - language, compiled
  with the sh.. oops.. sho good A86 - compiler :)

 As the sequel for this braindead intro visit Braindead BBS
 (+358-13-891 353, 24h, v.34, Braindead Software HQ 
  (meaning, that you can really contact ALL the members
   of Bdead there :), also specialized in paintball among
   those other fancy thingies :)
