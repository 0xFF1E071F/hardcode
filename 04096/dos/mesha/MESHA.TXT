        you'll need 580kb basemem, 8mb ram, himem.sys or dpmi to run this one
	
	if you see only a black screen, wait at least 20 seconds, the intro
	may be calculating (this means your machine sucks)

	if the intro is suddenly dropping you back to your os after starting
	means your config sucks. (error messages disabled)

        features:
        - 32bit pmode code, using an enhanced pmode extender
        - revolutionary object generation
        - 13.000+ vertices, 17.000+ faces processed during the intro
        - 7 totally different parts, no repeatings

        - 8 textures, 16 palettes

        - own packer/unpacker algorithm used, unpacker is 95 bytes
        - contains music but your card sucks so you can't hear it, and
          anyways asm.org people would have disqualified it if
          we had music enabled =)
