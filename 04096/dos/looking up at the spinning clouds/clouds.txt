þ a 4k

þ Info

  This is actually just a little experiment to see if I could write a
  4k in Watcom C in Protected-Mode (using Wext386 Extender). And I found
  I could, well.. at least try to.

  So, here is the one effect 4k, destined to be laughed at by those many
  around. :)

þ Requirements

  this needs a dos system running himem.sys only, no emm386 or windows
  running. simple.


  if it doesn't run, then bug 'ya.. it should run... knowing my luck, it'll
  die, but who cares...

þ Other Stuff

  Source code is available to those who ask... so mail me, if you wish...

  contact information, etc... look in xtatic.nfo

  later...
