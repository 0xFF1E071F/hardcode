  You can use the following `mask' to write an article for the ObTain diskmag.
The article must be 35 chars wide and 20 lines tall at maximum. Sorry for the
limits, but this is a 4K diskmag ;-). Wanna write more? Write for Obscurum!

Now let's go back to our page. You can use this mask as a guidance:

highlight the text after it's presence.

-=> Comments <=-

  Write an one-line comment for ObTain #2. You can write everything you want.
I'll try to put all of them in the next ObTain, but if they take too much space
i'll select the best of them:

    You are: ___________________________________
    You say: ___________________________________
    (you can mix the two abone by writing only your handle and putting text
    in the first line too)
