YO!!

  This intro is our attempt to 'win' Assembly '94 4kb intro competition :-D.
Our basic idea was, that landscape routine we released last year,
took too much space and we simply tried to made it fit into 4096 bytes
or less... Same time we did one nice Bezier-line draw & morphing routine
to improve the result of final version. Screen resolution we used was
320*240*256 so only 100% register compatible VGA-adapters will show the
whole intro right.

  Code is optimized by size (VERY MUCH) and speed (there was lot's of
unnecessary stuff spending expensive CPU time...). Because lack of space
given by party organizers we didn't have change to make it any longer
it's now...  Try it and enjoy. Remember, 'cause lack of time, we
couldn't make it any better....sorry for that...maybe next time..;-)

Hardware requirements:

         - 386SX/25 or above (DX33 or faster to move smoothly...)
         - 75kb free memory (You should have that much anyway)
         - Works fine with QEMM, EMM386 and other popular memory manager
         - No sound from ANY known soundcard (Blame party organizers!!!)
         - VGA adapter with 256kb memory on it!
         - DOS 3.2 or above (4DOS works too, very well indeed...)
         - That's all folks...

  We really hope this intro didn't bore you too much. We have planned to
release sources of this intro soon after the intro has been released.
The Intro has been coded mostly with Borland C++ 3.1 and code edited
with Qedit Advanced V3.0. The code has been optimized for Borland 3.1,
so it might not work on anything else, or even with earlier versions of
the compiler. Without fast food and Coca Cola, this production wouldn't
have ever finished.
