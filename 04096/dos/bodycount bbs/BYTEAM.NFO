  This little hungarian group was founded in 1993. When we first time went to
  a party, everybody laughed at us. But now WE will laugh at EVERYBODY else!!
  Our first release was a demo called Funny Covox, which was exactly 670 KB
  long. But actually it contained nothing...:)
  The group contains 8 members , who are (in the order of joining):
  -= RoByMuS =-.........................................................coder
  -= Blala =-...........................................................coder
  -= Megant =-.......................................................musician
  These were the founder members. Now the guys joined later:
  -= Leon Sky =-..........................................................gfx
  -= Plan-B =-............................................................gfx
  -= ZTS =-..........................................................musician
  -= HAL =-.......................................................gfx,swapper
  -= Murry =-.........................................................swapper
  So, fuckin' lotsa coderz.... hope you like what we have done!
  Actually, it may be slow on some machines, and stuff like that, because
  Hal has a dual Pentium with 32 Megz o'RAM, and I guess not all you
  guys out there have such a little toy...;))))
  BTW, what did you say when you saw what we stuffed into that 64Kb-s! When
  these motherfuckers on Cache'95 saw it, they did not believe that it's not a
  precalculated animation... but when we showed the 170K ASM file to them, they
  started to believe us....;) just4fun!
  It's time for some fuckin' booooooring greetz.... here we go...
begin
Watch it in the end part of thiz intro !     ;)
end
