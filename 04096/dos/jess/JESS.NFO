I wrote this Intro for the MEKKA + SYMPOSIUM 2k-1 in Fallinbostel lasting
from 2-nd until 4-th of April in 1999. It is dedicated to Jess B. who came
from the US to Zwickau and tried more or less successfully to teach us 
english.


Please run under DOS (without Windows in the background) and on (at least)
a Pentium 200.
