when the intro seems to be hanged at the beginning,
don't worry, it's just a precalculation..
this is very slow 'coz i hadn't got enough time for the optimizing..

the intro won the 7th price on the ASSEMBLY'95..
i released the full source code a few weeks after the party,
and i hope you can learn something from this..
