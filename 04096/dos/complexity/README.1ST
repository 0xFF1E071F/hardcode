when the intro seems to be hanged at the beginning,
don't worry, it's just a precalculation..
this is very slow 'coz i hadn't got enough time for the optimizing..

two versions of the intro exist:
CLXFINAL.COM - the final version
CLXPARTY.COM - the compo version, which does not contain the author's name
