 I. Story
 ~~~~~~~~
 Well, since you know the group's story very well (you read our website,
 didn't you?), I'll tell you about the story of this...well, bad thing.
 First off, it all started, when I downloaded Freestyle 8., the AI diskmag,
 and in the coder section, I read a pretty self-explaining bump routine by
 Murphy/Exact. I especially liked bump mapping, since I think bump is one of
 the most useable routines, and it can be done easily. Well, when D-lee of
 Exceed told me, that without a team, I should do 4K or 64K intros, I started
 thinking about a 4K. Firstly, I saw clearly that 3D is outta sight for me,
 since my old, soggy brain couldn't understand that damned 3D math routines.
 So much for 3D. I recently talked about it to Procyon and D'Soft, and D'Soft
 clearly stated that he won't take part in it. Procyon was happy to join the
 work, and I wanted to make him do the harder part, the bump :). But after
 many months of waiting and no code, I sat down, and started coding. I hadn't
 discovered ASM fully yet (Old, soggy brain (OSB) sucks), so I made a plan:
 First, I make a spine in TP, and then I translate it into ASM. Later the ASM
 fell out, when I saw E2K by Digital Dynamite on FLaG 2000 (full Pascal
 demo). I thought that nobody made any TP 4K-s yet, so why not? If it sucks,
 the prejury will filter it, am I right? So I sat down (usually, that's the
 way I code: I persuade myself to sit down, and away it goes.), and started
 coding. After a nice, but very lame attempt I recoded most of the source,
 and told Procyon to code a routine, that retrieves the system font. Same
 effect, nothing for weeks. Later I talked to Procyon, he said his family
 didn't let him code, and I found out that he was actually learning for his
 state exam in German. Poor dude. Viel glÅck. Well, it seemed to me, that I'm
 the only one staniding. All right, let's rock the boat a little. I coded,
 and coded, and coded, until one day, the pre-bump spotlight routine vanished
 and a bump took his place. The problem was the size. It was well over 4K
 (10K to be precise). But when I compiled it with TPC, It became 4,5K!!!
 Well, I thought, that's nice, guess I have to compress it. Later, on IRC,
 Ebola said, that the spotlight's boring, how about changing colors. OK, I
 said, and off it went. Then I received a heart attack: It became 6K. I
 rewrote the routine, so it became slower, but smaller (And my brain started
 to get dry :) ). With WWP compression, it became less than 4K. What does
 the C7007 partypeople think about it? That depends on the future. Hope they
 appreciate it. Well, we WILL see...
 Oh yeah, and the source is included. This also means no hidden parts. Sorry.

 II. Greets 'n' stuff
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Greets and thanks go to...
 ... Bas van Gaalen. Pascal Rules.
 ... Exceed. A huge thanks for keeping the feeling alive. Miskolc r00lz.
 ... the rest of ömlaÅt Design. Shame you didn't join the coding.
 ... the d00dz at irc.hu #demoscene. See ya beetween 3pm-5pm CET on Sat-Sun.
 ... The DD guys, BoyC'n'TrX. Me bump better than you flame. Me win!

 say a big hiho to the C7007 organizers.
