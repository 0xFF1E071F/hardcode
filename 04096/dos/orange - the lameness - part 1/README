Oh, this is just a technical demonstration of my gfx-packer.
It is similar to PNG, no loss from the original,
with a very good ratio (300*146*16col, 21900-=>3320 byte), and the
depacker is 310 bytes (I know, it could be better :)

The orange logo is ripped from a tg'97 demo, because we don't have a
graphician, and this pic is just what I needed, so thx destop (or whoever
made it)!!

Greetings to:  (I know, you read this only for this)

You may waited a normal and complex intro, but you know, the lack of time
and skill...

Now, enough from smileys.
