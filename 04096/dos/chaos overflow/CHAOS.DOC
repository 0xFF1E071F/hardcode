      About the intro:

            There might be some problems after running it,
            but I don't knew why. I recomment boot after
            runing it, anyway it works perfectly on my 386.

      Note:

            It do not work under windows or any protected-mode
            systems. Requires DOS. Tested only on MS-DOS and
            4DOS.
