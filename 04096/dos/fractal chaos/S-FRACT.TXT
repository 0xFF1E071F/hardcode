 This  little piece of code  is  my first  production  on PC-machines.
 All coding is made in one day (14 hours),  which explains the quality
 of design. Everything is offcource 100% assembly  code.  At least 386
 is needed  to run this  production,  because of  the 32-bit  register
 usage and  32-bit memory addressing. A fast  VGA card is recommended.
 I have had PC for about three months now and I have coded iNTEL about
 one month, but the code is FAST! and tight.  The chaos doesn't have a
 bug in bottom right  corner -  4k was  just too less for bigger chaos
 area. Everything in this intro is realtime  calculated,  no animation
 is used.
