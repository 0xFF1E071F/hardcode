This is only the 3rd assembler program I have written for the PC (the first
two wrote 'Hello' on the screen) so please forgive any bad coding you might
find.  I have included the source code for your amusement so feel free to
have a good laugh at it :)

System requirements : CGA, 8086 or better (can you get any worse ? :)).

This is an advert for my BBS.  It is all free and you do not have to register
to start downloading, uploading or using the E-mail and message bases.

It is sharing the fax line with Cavendish Computers Cambridge so it is not
open during business hours, but on the plus side, if you want to enquire about
computer systems or parts just leave E-Mail to SYSOP when you log on.  If you
require technical assistance get in touch and I will try to help you out.

The Shed does not have Gigabytes of on-line storage, but what IS there is only
the best quality software that meets my high standards (plus some old crap
that I wrote).  As well as the 150 Megs on-line I also have about 1 Gig on CD-
ROM and tape which I am happy to share. The stuff on it at the moment is
mainly demos, programming stuff, graphics programs and utilities as they are
my main interests, but this might change if people want other things.
The Shed is currently evaluating Pinnacle's Free Speech BBS door so log on and
check it out.

Send any comments, fan mail, death threats etc. to :

dws@ras.phy.cam.ac.uk (Internet) or better still log onto The Shed and leave a
message for me there.

Cheers, Naich.
