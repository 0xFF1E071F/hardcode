echo Welcome to YAR - the only 4K intro with a batch file
echo.
echo YAR uses the latest YARTRACING techniques, so if you
echo have no idea how to make effects like this, don't feel
echo so bad about it. We know this is too complex for you.
echo.
echo One more thing... you HAVE too press ESC at every effect
echo to step to the next one. That's NOT because I'm so lazy
echo that I didn't use a timer, but because this way you can
echo enjoy the effects as long as you want :)
echo.
echo You can press a key now to be amazed...
