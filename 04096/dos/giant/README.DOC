                      G I A N T - the Ultimate 4KB-Intro!
                      ===================================

              written by ä, STP (Sigma of Star Team Productions)

  This Little 4kb Intro was released in Assembly '94. The party was held in
  Helsinki, the Capital of Finland, 5th - 7th August 1994. This little intro
  took part part in the 4KB-Intro Compo.

  This Intro is released as Free Ware. You can spread it as much as you want
  but all these files must be kept together:

        README.DOC      - this file
        GIANT.COM       - released PD version
        GIANTSHW.COM    - Assembly '94 Compo version
                          (Does not have my Name or Group Name)
        RUNHELP.BAT     - for solving some problems
        FILE_ID.DIZ     - File info

  You can also modify this intro if you want BUT DO NOT SPREAD IT unless it is
  modified enough! And remember also to put YOUR OWN NAME in your Intro.

  To run this intro the minimum possible composition is

                - a 386 or better
                - a math coprocessor (or emulator = slow intro!)
                - VGA card (100% VGA Compatible on register level)
                - 320 kb free memory
                  (the file is compressed and has some Large memory tables!)
                - DOS v. 3.0 or better

  but my suggestion is

                - at least a 486DX2/66
                - A FAST Local Bus VGA Card
                  (100% VGA Compatible on register level)

  On a FAST 486DX2/66 the approximate running time is 2'45.

  This Intro is also a preview for all you who are interested in file
  compressing. These COM-files are compressed with my own XPACK-method that
  makes files much tighter than PKLITE or LZEXE etc. Compressing is faster, too!
  A small decompressing routine is at the beginning of these COM-files and that
  routine is about 100 bytes long. I'm going to release this Executable File
  Compressor some day in the future.

  I would like to thank following persons that have made all this possible and
  given me great hints for programming this intro:
        Tim Clarke,     for Martian terrain renderer
                        (especially marsinfo.txt) which can be found at
                        garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/demo/mars10.zip.

        Paul H. Kahler, for rotates/pans/scales a 256x256 bitmap.

        NutCracker of the Immortal Syndicate, for help in programming Shadebobs.

  My Greetings go to:
