			Another Dutch Production


			      REQUIREMENTS

      A 386 or better processor, VGA or compatible graphics card and about
      450kb of base memory is required to run "Shorty"
      A 486dx2 or better is strongly recommended.

			   INTRO INFORMATION

      This 4Kb intro was coded by me in 6 weeks spreaded over 3 months.
      Most of the time you hear from people, that they worked 2-3 days
      on their 4Kb, well it can be done, but I had to write the whole 3D
      engine from the beginning, most of the routines were already made
      in PMode, but for example the texturemap routine, had to be totaly
      rewritten because the Pmode routine is about 64Kb"big", but atleast
      10 times faster. So after all I don't think I worked too long on this
      project. Now we actually have a Real-mode engine also. So more to
      expect from me and ThE ClaN soon(64Kb and 4Kb). In the beginning I
      spend hours on size optimizing that's why the Tube effect is done in
      only 312 bytes, but at a sertain moment, even PKLITE could compress it,
      so I just coded and used WWPack to optimize for size.
      Don't blame me that it's running slow on your 386DX40 or even less,
      which by the way is the type of computer I'm still working on,
      but it's mainly designed for 486DX2-66 or even faster, just because
      everyone has such computer these days, and 3D sucks CPU ticks.

      Design, deuh is there ??, came while programming it, I liked the blue
      color for the background, so my first idea was to make a totaly blue
      4Kb, but afterall that was soooooooo boring, that I changed the upper
      128 color to black->red->white, which was less boring to me.


			      WHAT YOU SEE

      - background pictures calculated during weird self modifying code.
      - A half texturemapped tube comming around.
      - flash
      - 3D rotating and morphing with phong mapping.
      - flash
      - again those objects but now with phong-refraction mapping.
	which give the effect of looking through red-glass.
      - flash. and woops background is gone...
      - and again those objects but now phong-blur.


			     "OPSCHEPPERIJ"

      Each object has 384 points, 384 vertex normals and 704 polygons.
      Total 1536 points, 1536 normals and 2816 polygons, total size when
      normals are calculated should be around 26112 bytes uncompressed.
      The textured tube and background was coded within 452 bytes...
      All polygons are double textured, however only the refraction part
      uses the second texture, in the others parts the second texture is
      just BLACK..
      486DX2-66 will result in about 14 frames per second.
