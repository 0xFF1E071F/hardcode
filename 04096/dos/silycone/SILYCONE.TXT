          An 4kb-Intro presented at Hype-97 in Malmoe (Sweden),
        14-16th Feb. It took 2nd place out of 13 more or less
        seriously ment compos. This intro is optimized for Size
        and NOT for speed, therefore it needs a P133 to run
        at 70 fps (total time 3:35).

                   Code:           Spyko
                   Graphics:       Graphics? Whats that?
                   Music:          Sorry, there was no
                                     space for that. 


        What type of computer do you need?

        þ  It will probably run on a 386, but the computer will
           be completely covered with silicon, so DONT do it!
           As I said, on a P133 everything runs smooth at 70 fps.
        þ  The intro needs about 256 kb free memory, it may work
           with less, but I dont take any responsibility for what
           happens afterwards.
