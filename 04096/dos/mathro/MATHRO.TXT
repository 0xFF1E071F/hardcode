Hi people! This is Technolord of the Chaotic Visions spreading out a
new intro named (guess ;) MATHro

GENERAL INFOS:
  I coded it in a lot of days, mostly 'cos it's a "first experience intro"
(all the effects inside have been coded by me here for the real first time)
so I can't really get more out of it. I would really place somewhat more
inside but time lacks and I must respect the deadline - today!
Inside, in order, the following effects:
  Mandelbrot set
  Julia Set
  Deformed (reflection) rotozoomer
  Voxel (randomly generated)
  (disturbed) Texture Mapping
To end the demo press a key when it's in the Tmap session

This should work on all computers having at least a 386sx, 256k of freemem
and a VGA (sorry, no check for VGA nor CPU).
It should word under OS/2 and W95 but do not bet on it :-)
I truly recommend at least a 486sx (or a 386 if you love 1FPS :-)

This intro can be freely distributed as long as it remains intact (no
modifications to the code or somewhat else) and the package remains
complete - FILE_ID.DIZ, MATHro.COM, MATHro.TXT, MATHro.ASM, MATHro.INC.

It's much cutted-away, since it have been linked the same day the deadline
was, so no credits, fancy effects or pre-compiled tables, sorry.
