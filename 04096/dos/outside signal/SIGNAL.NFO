1. Members
   Actually, the only active member in the group is Spock (Oscar Portela 
Arjona), a coder, but we're ready to accept lots of new members - coders,
musicians, graphic artists... - for our new productions...

2. Productions
        The first production released was "First Attempt", a 64kb intro
I made for the Euskal Party 5 (a real lame prod ;-) ).
        This is the second production I've made. It runs full framerate
(40 fps) on my K6-200, and will output some extra stuff to any hercules or
mda card present in your computer. For those of you not having such old
hardware, here goes some of the text printed there:

Note: Due to compatibility problems, hercules output has been disabled in
      standart version (signal.com). To see the beautiful and overhelming
      hercules effects, execute the extended version, signalhg.com

 Welcome to IRC channel #idarkness
 
 <Quest> Hi, anyone out there?
 <Spock> Yeah
 <Quest> What's all the stuff I've in my other monitor?
 <Spock> Well, it's a 4k's intro I made for Euskal Party 7
 <Spock> Do you like it?
 <Quest> Well, uhmm, it's pretty basic...
 <Spock> I know, but I've some better ideas for the next prod
 <Spock> However It could have been cooler if you have made some music
 <Spock> You are in this demogroup as well, remember?
 <Quest> Yes, but...
 <Spock> And you didn't released any song at the party
 <Quest> But I couldn't go there...
 <Spock> No matter, let's start working by now, understood?
 <Quest> Ok
 -Quest left the channel
 <Spock> Hunn, that's what he always says
 <Spock> Maybe it's time for introducing other people in the demogroup
 <Spock> Are you interested? Good. Then e-mail me to spockid@geocities.com
 -Channel topic is now "We are looking for people"
