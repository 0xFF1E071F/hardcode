
squell^zf! presents his first ever attempt at a 4kb..
run for your lives, or run the executable. =]

ok, it's not very brilliant or original (imho) but what the fuck.

like. .just run it in a plain dos mode or someting.. doesnt need
any fucking memory manager.. just enough free base mem.. about 512k will
do fine.. more is even better... well.. who cares..

if you don't know how to run this, it's time you start to question
if you're the right guy to organize these things. =]]]
