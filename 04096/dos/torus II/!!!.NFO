PENTiUM-133 is fully recommended !!!
The organizers of RaGE`97 are allowed to put
this intro on their CD-ROM disk with party stuff,
but they have to send me one copy of it !!!
You can give it also with prices (if it wins
sumthing) to BLaLa/ByTeaM who will give this
4Kb-intro into competition...
Special thnx to BLaLa/ByTeaM !!!
