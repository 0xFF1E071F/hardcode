This is my contribution to the PC 4k-intro competition at Assembly '95 in
Helsinki, Finland, released on the 11 of August 1995.

It contains some space-cutted vector objects, twisting and
twirling plasmaclouds and of course some not-so-nice scrolltext.
The spacecut-part makes heavy use of the FPU, and I just love the FSINCOS
instruction! :-)

Hmmm, and what about some greetings?

- All of you in TBL, especially Offa, Hitman, Fishbone, Ken, Equalizer, Axm,
  Snorpax Tudor and Gizmo, joining me here in this one-night-with-the-boat-
  from-Stockholm place. Rubberduck gets no greetings because he rather goes
  to school than to a party :-) 

- Everyone else here at the party (of course)

- The Swedish space-pop-group S.P.O.C.K for their music which makes coding
  possible twenty-five hours a day.

- Hanna Carlsson for dragging me to the S.P.O.C.K-concert in Norrk”ping.

- And finally Malin B”rjesson for saving my summer.
