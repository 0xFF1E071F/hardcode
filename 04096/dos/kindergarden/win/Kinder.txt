 -1. Final version
 ---------------------

 Hi. This is the port of another 4k intro by Glue. It is not really optimized 
 for  size, I just created a window and dump the framebuffer to it. No tricks 
 or strange code, so it should perfectly load and run on all windows versions
 (I tested it on Win98, 2000 and XP.

 The intro is not 100% equal to the original one, specially in the timing of
 the text. It was a long time ago the last time I saw the intro, so I don't
 remember very well how it was. However, the deformation, scenes, cameras and
 textures are the same.

 In this Windows version I changed a bit the code of the raytracer to use P6
 instructions (FCOMI) to do a bit faster intersection tests. Anyway, it is 
 quite slow, cause the original code was optimized for size, not speed, and I
 dind't want to spend more than one day rewriting my own code. Converting 
 from DOS/TASM to WIN/NASM has been enought work.

 I have done two versions, one with interpolation for the raytracer and the
 another without. Well, hope you enjoy it.

 1. Just some words
 ---------------------

    hmmm... this is our first 4k intro... i (me, Iq) never had programmed in
    asm before, but i decided to start with it some months ago. this is the
    result of the work done during this time. i started to make the raytracer,
    some 2d deformations and the mini-texture generator. Geiger saw these
    things and we decided to make an intro. he made the font generator and
    a new 2d efect. then, we put all together and tried to present it on
    xuventude galicia net party, but it was imposible because the intro
    was 5.600 bytes long! so, we thought to try again in euskalparty. we
    remade the font generator, the raytracer and the main loop, and we
    achieved (at last) to make the intro 4k long. so, here it is. we hope
    you like it.

    ah, we made some versions of the intro so that everybody can watch
    the intro:

    kinder_a.exe    :   320 x 240 x 32
    kinder_b.exe    :   320 x 240 x 24
    kinder_c.exe    :   320 x 200 x 32
    kinder_d.exe    :   320 x 200 x 24

 2. The intro
 ---------------------

    well. just to let you make an idea, the executabla real size is
    5264 bytes. and apack helps us to make it no more than 4k size :)

    now, a short description of the main parts of the intro...

    ..fonts :

    yeah, we generate the fonts! they are antialiased, you see, and we can
    generate them in any resolution we want. it's geirger's works,
    genious'work. ah!, the font generator takes no more than 1 kb!

    ..raytracer:

    absolutly not speed optimized raytracer. the first raytracer (the
    one we wanted to present in the xuventude's version) was able to
    raytrace planes, spheres and cylinders, and it was quite fast...
    however, the code was too big. so i decided to rewrite de raytracer
    and to make it able to intersect "just" cuadrics. of course, this
    made the code smaller, but also the raytracer much more slower :(

    ..2d deformations:

    they are beatifull, aren't they? the main idea and code is Geiger's,
    our 2d man. i just made the fpu code to generate de deformations
    themselves.

    ..textures:

    the intro generates three 256x256 true color simple textures. we could
    have generate more with no space cost, but they are all of them very
    similar, so... anyway, the mini-texture generator makes just fractal
    plasmas and have three filters. the extended version was able to make
    more sofisticated textures, but you know... 4k is 4k...

    hey, Ufix, at last the plasma rutine is 178 bytes long!

    sorry, because this short poem above (made by me) is written in
    spanish.

    "el mar y t£:
     
     Cu ntas almas en el regazo del mar se han sentado
     cont ndole penas, desahogando su melancol¡a,
     o pidi‚ndole ruegos o expres ndole su alegr¡a,
     y esperando una contestaci¢n, el sonido de las olas han escuchado.
     
     De su inmensidad nacen miles de esperanzas y decisiones
     pues miles de almas en ‚l buscan respuestas y comprensi¢n,
     un hombro en el que llorar, un amigo de coraz¢n
     alguien que escuche todas nuestras emociones.
     
     Y es que sencillo es notar que el mar te escucha y te comprende
     .
     .
     como un un coraz¢n dadiboso que sabidur¡a y comprensi¢n desprende.
     
     Pero al hablarle al mar, a nosotros mismos nos hablamos en verdad,
     porque las aguas de un mar enfurecido o un mar en calma,
     no son m s que un simple espejo de nuestro alma
     y de ellas escuchamos lo que nosotros mismos cabilamos en soledad."
                    
    Espero que os haya gustado.
