  Well, here is a 4kb intro. I hope you will like it... 
  Normally, in this archive you should find the executable file, this
small text, and also another archive containing the sources and datas
of this mini intro. In case you appreciate this (the intro, or the
sources), please send me a nice postcard. (Cheap, and very valuable when
I receive it!)
  Also, if you are interested in talking about code (2d & 3d graphics, 
fractals, packers, mathematics...) or books (my fave author is P.K Dick,
but I love SciFi and Heroic Fantasy as well) or simply if you are a cool
guy, feel free to contact me...
