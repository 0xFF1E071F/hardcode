-----------

General Information

  This is a fuckin' lame non final version of Prime. (Whoever wants
  to know: A hardisk crash delayd me severly...) 
  You can see this at mainly these points:
  - One big bug. If the 3d Objects appear displaced, try a clean
    (realy clean!) boot. Might fix it.
  - There is still plenty of space left for the not yet done muzak.
    Simply imagine some kewl tune in the background.
  - Some obvious size optimisations were left out. (Should only 
    worry coders :)
  - The 3d Logo still represents my former group, Videopolis.
  - No hardware check upon startup. If you see a blank screen, this
    might very well be caused by a missing copro. (486SX, sorry!)
  But now to the oh-so-boring hardware requirements:
  - 486DX processor (50++ Mhz recomended)
  - 386 with copro 387 should work, but is definitifly NOT recomended.
  - VGA of coz (straight 13h 320x200x256)
  - Something like 400k of base memory (null sheen)
  - TSR free memory (works with, too, but may crash)
  - Keyboard... okay, I'm losing it...

Some tech stuff and general blather

  Now, folks, before I forgett to mention it: This Intro is called Prime
  coz of two reasons:
  - It's my first Intro (actually even my first release) ever
  - It's prime code (nuff said) (-:
  Tch. Then, for everybody lame: This intro was first released at the
  Mekka 96 Party in Germany (which you didn't attend) where it scored
  xxth at the compo. 
  The 3d code was quite tricky to do, and is a mixture between Goraude
  and Phong shading. Maybe I should credit Elliot/Epsilon for the
  tunnel. I first saw it in his cool Lion Intro.
  As you might guess the 3d uses floating point. It's much more size
  coherent than the fixed stuff.
