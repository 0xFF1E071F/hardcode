
      Just a few words... Works with clean-boot, also tested with
      other configurations like with QEMM and it worked fine. I
      recommend fast (66 MHz) 486 with PCI VGA-adapter. Requires VGA
      and at least 80486 processor as you probably knew. This isn't
      designed for 386 computers, because competition computer was 
      486 with new features.


      Thanx to TaskMaster/Gollum for loaning his computer at
      the party place.


      Would you like to contact me?
