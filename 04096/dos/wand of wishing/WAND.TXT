You should have the blaster environment variable set in order to get sound.
Otherwise the intro will assume it should use A220 I7 D1. Alternatively you
can give the environment setting as command line input to the program. ("wand
A220 I5 D1" for example) Note that the environment variable is always used if
found, so see to it that it is correct or not specified at all.

It might be that my Sound Blaster routines suck because I haven't been able
to test them enough. They should work well with any DMA(8bit) and base 
address but high IRQ:s may suck. You should avoid using high IRQ:s and a
bad DMA or base address, the intro will tilt (it will not display an error
message as it should). But if you are using a high IRQ and good base and
DMA values the intro will wait and tilt in the end... (and I think you will
hear sound during the intro =) )

I think it was a very good idea to allow sound and music in the 4kb compo.
Any demo or intro is very boring without sound, especially 4kb intros because
they tend to be very boring anyway. The music in Wand of Wishing was software
synthesized and therefore I managed to avoid those terrible adlib sounds.

Oddly enough the size limit was not a problem for me this time! I thought it
always would be when making 4kb intros, but this time it was different. Maybe
it was because my "3d effect engine" takes less than 512 bytes(!). It works
in a quite special way as you might imagine...
