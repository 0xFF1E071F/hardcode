    Foundation.

    Mike  -> If you order now, you get a free TEXTFILE!!! YEAH!!

    Manual:

    Escape should break the whole thing of, Enter skips the current
    scene (well actually it sets the timer to 0 :). Pretty simple,
    isn't it? :)

    Comments:

    Ok, as you have noticed, the above is just a bunch of CRAP, floating
    from a "tweaked mind"!

    This intro just contains some nice fx and some REALLY basic 3D. But,
    and I hope you all agree, it contains a cool design! For 4k anyway :).

    You can expect a sourcecode release of the 4k soon, on my website and
    the t3f ftpsite. I just want to say one thing about that:

                            OPEN SOURCE RULEZ!!

    Thanx 2:

    Jibz                APACK rules forever (well atleast no it does :)
    Sabre2th            For the plasma-like-thingy, while I was coding
                        some design thingies, he came up with that :).
    Ile and Ritz        They did extensive spell-checking here!! ;).
