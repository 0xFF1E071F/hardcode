    this  intro requires a pentium processor to run.  due to realtime  sound
    synthesis a p166 recommended.  for  sound output a  gus is required with
    proper ultrasnd= variable.  without  soundcard  the intro will not run !
    sorry,  no bytes  left  for workaround.  also  check the ammount of free
    memory before executing,  because no error detection performed.   59o kb
    should be enough.  be aware that the dma buffer is  hardcoded to segment
    8oooh so you must have that address free, no  bytes left for  allocation
    routine.  if you do a clean boot  with just  himem installed  everything
    should work properly. btw; the slowest cpu the intro was tested on was a
    486dx4-1oo - everything was ok!

    this intro uses realtime sound synthesis, like rebirth338 or rubberduck.
    three  24 dB  psychoaccoustic lowpass filters generate the sound  of the
    3o3s and the 8o8. the 8o8 samples are precalculated at startup, using an
    algorithm based on a program called stomper.  theese algorithms are part
    of our big project, the chrome-tracker.  it will  have the features like
    impulse tracker, plus realtime filters, equalizers, tb3o3 and a complete
    analogue modular synth  emulation with dsp effects.   of course  it will
    require  a  very  fast processor  for realtime sound output, but it will
    render the tracks into wav files if you wish.

    ù atx for showing me te capabilities of a juno synth, it helped a lot in
      coding the realtime filters.
    ù enok for believing it is possible in 4kb. without his faith this intro
      would never have done.
    ù enok and atx for letting me [net] code on their computer.
    ù my friend csabi for lending me his 486 for final tests.
    ù the creators of rebirth. the sound of rebirth was the standard for me.
