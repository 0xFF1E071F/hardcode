The Blue Man by Preacher of NoID and Static
-------------------------------------------

This intro was coded for the assembly2k 4kb intro compo. I know, it lacks
design and cool stuff, but I wanted to make something at least a bit
different.. it was coded in about three days, which is the reason it looks
so unfinished. Some of the code is quite old, so no state-of-the-art effects
here :)

Technical information
---------------------
100% realmode asm code in good old mode 13h
Needs some memory, works fine with my 545kb
Coded in w95 dos box, so should work there. Tested also on Linux dosemu
without problems
Unfortunately there's no music in this intro, I just couldn't make myself
code a player. Next time it will be better :)
I used UPX to pack this thing, you can find it at www.nexus.hu/upx

I could put some more stuff in but I don't really feel like it anymore, so
I'm submitting this version

RodeX said, that it looks like his year 95 code... and I have to agree. But
hey, I didn't say it was good :)

Greetings & stuff
-----------------
Everyone here at Asm2k, even though most of them are playing some stupid
games. I'm sitting right here in the scene area and just behind us there
are some lamers playing counterstrike.. well, I guess I won't be here next
year then :)
Anyway, special hellos to everyone who still likes 4k intros and/or codes
them, and everyone who is even remotely interested in scene here..

Oh yeah, and remember: If you distribute it any way, please do so, but tell

would pay :)).
