Information file for "Tomte"


This production will require the following
        
        - free conventional memory: 580kb
        - boot information: CLEAN boot

Clean boot means that you should boot your machine with out any other drivers
than HIMEM.SYS, so your config.sys will look like this:

CONFIG.SYS:
device=c:\dos\himem.sys
dos=high

and your AUTOEXEC.BAT is empty or you can load your favourite mouse driver.
