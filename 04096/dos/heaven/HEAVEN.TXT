        HEAVEN                                          NOOON Productions
        code by BARTi
        august 10th 1995

        it's a one night of coding intro, be indulgent, the code is optimized
        for the size and not for speed it's for that reason that the 3d engine
        is slow. (i do spacecut all the time even when it isn't necessary)
        you can copy it as long as the files included remain unchanged.
        it requires near 450kb of low memory to run, no problem with TSRs.
        it contains :
          - a fractal cloud landscape of 32000 pixels
          - a blue and yellow bounded torus with vertical rays of 19239 polys
          - a Lebreton tunnel of 64000 pixels (not larusse)
          - a pink and yellow torus of 31489 polys by M. Jujote
          - textures drawn by me with R.T.A.S.M
          - and a thanx to schwartz who first invented the fire purple
            background and to karl for making it in 37 bytes
          - can a Lebreton fractal cloud glenz tunnel lead us to the HEAVEN ?
          - a realtime triple donnuts space cut
          - but the question is : torus or donnuts ?
