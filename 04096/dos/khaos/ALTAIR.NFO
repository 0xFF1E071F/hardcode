 ≤
 ≤           So  you  want  to  know what ALTAIR is. If you do, just
 ≤      take  any  star  atlas  or  something and check it! You will
 ≤      surely  find  word  "altair" there. If you are not satisfied
 ≤      with  this answer, here is an alternative one: 'Altair' is a
 ≤      name  of a polish demoscene group which happened to take its
 ≤      name  from a celestial body called so. Still don't know what
 ≤      I  am  talking about? Well, I am afraid I cannot help you...
 ≤      Just  keep on reading and you might soon get an idea of what
 ≤      'Altair' really is.
 ≤
 ≤           Altair  was founded by GED and Stealth a long time ago.
 ≤      GED  had  an Amiga and was supposed to be an artist and main
 ≤      organizer;  Stealth had a PC and was supposed to be a coder.
 ≤      But  because  of  laziness  and  lack of time, our group did
 ≤      barely  more  than  just  exist.  In  the  beginning of 1997
 ≤      something  began  to  change.  In  the meantime, some people
 ≤      joined  the group, GED became Malfunction and Stealth became
 ≤      BlueShade.   Amongst   those  who  joined  our  group  were:
 ≤      Corrozya,  Dzozef,  Harvuh  (calling  himself Axis now). The
 ≤      first  official appearance of Altair on the scene occured on
 ≤      Intel  Outside  4  Party held in July of 1997 in the city of
 ≤      Wloclawek,  Poland.  We presented some of our work there and
 ≤      even  made  it  to the second place with Dzozef's, and MLF's
 ≤      DNA  64k  intro. We relased some other productions there but
 ≤      they  were  not  rated  so  high.  This year we have been to
 ≤      RushHours98 and relased some artwork as well as one 256-byte
 ≤      intro.  Our  next  move was to come to Quast98 Party held at
 ≤      Elblag  in  July. Almost unanimously, we think that this was
 ≤      the  nicest  party we have been to as a group... The relases
 ≤      there  include  music, ray, gfx and 256b intro (the last one
 ≤      came  3rd  in  the  compo  :). At Satellite, we relased some
 ≤      music  but  failed  to  stay in Szczecin (the city where the
 ≤      party  was  held)  until  the  end  of the party due to some
 ≤      higher  powers...  During  the  next  few months, as we were
 ≤      preparing for FreeSide (which failed to take place) and then
 ≤      for  Astrosyn  2, some things have changed. First, our group
 ≤      gained  a new coder - Lett. Then we were joined by two other
 ≤      guys: DJ Regal (swapper and musician) and Singer (musician).
 ≤      And  thus  came Astrosyn 2. The party was nice although some
 ≤      might  disagree  with this opinion. At least it was nice for
 ≤      us,  who  managed  to: 1) have real fun, 2) estabilish a new
 ≤      group called United Dancers (you will surely hear about that
 ≤      if  you  hadn't  already), 3) win two 1st places and one 2nd
 ≤      place (4k intro, gfx and 64k intro  ;), 4) join new member -
 ≤      Insect (swapper and ascii-maker)...
 ≤           Let's wait for more . . .
