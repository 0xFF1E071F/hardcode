This 4k came second at Coven 98, 4k compo. Hope you like it, it took me a
month to code it. I ran out of space by the end, and there were still some
more effects which I wanted to put in. You will probably see them in AM's
future releases. Speaking of releases the AM music disk should be coming
out in November or early next year.

I wrote this 4k on a Pentium 166 MMX but it runs fine even on a 486 DX.

The first place coders didn't attend the party so I got the prize. :)

Thanx to:  RubiXcom for suggesting some effects.
           Emergent Software for sponsoring Coven.

Greetz to: MZ - Great party. Hope to see another one in 2000.
           Phorte - It was nice to meet you.
           Black Fox - I still think your XM should have won.
           Shock - nice try with a pure C 4k.

           also; DF, Jestyr, Factory, HB, Clef and other kewl coder dudes.
