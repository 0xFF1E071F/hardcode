                               DISTRIBUTION

        Fractals is my contribution to the Assembly '94 4kb intro
        competition. You can copy it as long as the files included
        remain unchanged and no fee is charged. If you're planning to
        distribute it as shareware, on a commercial shareware-cd, for
        example, please contact me. This product can be released on the
        Assembly '94 -cd if a fair royalty based on the votings is paid
        to the author.
        

                               REQUIREMENTS

        Fractals will only run on a 386 or greater, hower it requires
        under 200kb of base memory memory. A vga is also required. It
        won't need any memory managers.

                                   BUGS

        The desert scrolly might be a bit jerky on a slower video card
        because the hardware scrolly that worked on my cirrus svga
        didn't work on the compo machine, and I had to change it to a
        stupid videomem->videomem copy.
