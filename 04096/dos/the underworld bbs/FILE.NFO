  Yeah ! This is the last BBS add-on for the Underworld BBS in Switzlerland.

     Code .............................. Dake
  
 
 [=[ Requirements ]=========================================================]  
  
     It needs at least a 386 because the comet effect is quite slow. 
     A VGA compatible card is needed.

 
 [=[ Known Bugs ]===========================================================]  

     On some uncompatible cards and screens (Laptop), the video mode
     can create some problems because it's not a BIOS mode.
     If you encounter this problem, I can't do anything for you. :( 
     Try to launch it on another computer. 
  
 
 [=[ Technical Informations ]===============================================]  

     Code is 100% ASM. I used A86 v 4.01 to compile it. No 386 
     instructions. It's like a feedback effect but I added a rotation 
     so you've a zoom, a fire effect (blur) and a rotation. To make
     the "crackle" effect in fire, I used random numbers. The video mode 
     is a tweaked 256x128 described in Imphobia N¯11.
     
     I will soon release the source code on my site, FTP and Underworld 
     off course.
