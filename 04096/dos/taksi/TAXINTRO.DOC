INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTRO:
----------------------------

        The 13 frame animation to this intro was made in horry somewhere
        in the time of 1995. All graphics is drawn in TheDraw 4.62, and
        code is written in Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0, but it's mainly 
        ASSEMBLER to get the smallest possible size. The EXEcutable file
        is compiled with TPC.EXE which came with Turbo Pascal 7.0 and
        packed with DIET 1.45f. Graphics were drawn by Sliver/Brainlez
        Coders! and so is the code also written by Sliver/Brainlez Coders!
        ANSI graphics were included to the code with TheDraw's "SAVE TO
        PASCAL" option and Crunched with it. This info file is written
        in Technical Editor 2.61 by Sliver/Brainlez Coders!
