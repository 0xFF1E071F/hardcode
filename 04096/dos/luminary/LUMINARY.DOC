                   Hello dear pc freax and other maniacs!.
                   ---------------------------------------

This little intro have been thorwn out by a well known guy (??!) on C=64 site,
 >> JER <<, okay thanx anyway for reading also this document file,
 so you think i'm good, or bad coder, my personal reaction of this intro is
 that, it shouldn't ever be that better, just a code that basic coders
 likes do, so don't take it seriously as i said before.

 Intro code by Jer/mips Mango, the international strayers at the state of art.

                           code with tasm better, C-language is also nice,
                           but slow, and sometimes not enough optimizable,
                           i think..)
