# The raytracing algorithm is quite correct and realtime, of course. I hope
# to be able to do realtime raytracing of triangels soon (I'm so damn
# close...). If this is possible yet, CONTACT ME NOW! Or I'll
# think for hours for nothing. If you'd like
# to help me reducing my "bugs" (only a
# few left, I hope) CONTACT
# ME, TOO!!!
