Hello !

This is the complete source-code of "spam", a 4k-intro, which got the 2nd
place at the assembly 94 4k-intro-compo. Just run it through tasm and tlink,
and it will work (the makefile will also work). There are some comments
in the source, so you might be lucky and understand how it works :-) Just a
few things to tell you ...

   * Although spam does not use ems, emm might be useful to prevent crashes
     sometimes (don't ask me why)
   * If you have a nice vga-card (like cirrus), you can leave away the _LAME
     switch and get extra speed. On some vga-cards it is possible to reduce
     the horizontal resolution to 160 pixel (on some not, it seems)

If you encounter any problems, feel free to contact me:

    Tobias Gloth - Falkenstr. 2 - 49835 Lohne - Germany - (+49)5908-588
    or gloth@uni-muenster.de

Special thanks to chicken, antibyte, cassiopeia, m_rex (and all others) who
helped me to fix most bugs :)

Greetings, xToto
