        this little intro was done at 7th/may/1996.. making this thing took
        about 1 hour. i included the source so you can see how lame i am.
        little optimizing took from 15 to 20 minutes, it wasn't necessary
        but i wanted to make this smaller.
        
        idea for thiskindashit i got when i was coming back to my home from
        heap... another animation 4kb intro (i made one for asm'95 too, but
        it was full textmode+ansi) but this time in graphics.
        
        so how to make a vga animation to 4kb? i remembered this "taksi" 
        4kb intro what i made for asm'95. so i decided to use the same system,
        this time only asciis and then drawn to vga with some blur and error
        on it. it look quite nice in my mind and it looks quite cute on my
        screen. hope someone else likes this too. oh. thanks to heap for 
        telling me about such a command like "hlt" - i'm a real lame beginner
        in asm and i didn't know that there was so easy way to make delay..
        (it made this thing something like 11 bytes smaller ;))
        
        greetings to all friends. i don't want to mention any names, you guys
        must be really shamed now coz you know me :)
