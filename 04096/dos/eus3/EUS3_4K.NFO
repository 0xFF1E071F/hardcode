Hello everybody - Cranky at the keyboard.

This 2684-byte piece of sh** is my contribution to the 4K
intro compo in the Euskal Party III. It got the 3rd place
(of course, we were three contestants in total) :-)

It was coded in nearly 1 hour (I was not thinking of
presenting anything, but some wires became crossed inside
my head just 60 minutes before the deadline). I started to
make something to see if it could be mercy to be called a
4K intro, and after some ugly effects I got the vertical
lines background you can see in there. I didn't like it,
but since there was no time I took it as the starting
point. The rest was done by mounting some effects I'd done 
before. It's compacted with COMPACK (since the font itself
is 4096 bytes long, it could never be a 4K intro if it was
not compacted). The file size is distributed as follows:

* EXE Header: 48 bytes
* Initialization: 209 bytes (including ground texture)
* Transparent text scroller: 147 bytes
* Parallax: 143 bytes
* Ending code: 41 bytes
* Misc routines (LCG, Fade, VR, Palette rotation, background): 212 bytes
* Palette: 768 bytes
* Font: 4096 bytes (a total waste, I know, but I had no time to shorten it)
* Initialized variables: 6 bytes
* Text: 50 bytes

* Total: 5720 bytes
* COMPACK reduces it to: 2684 bytes

Note that if I could have enough time to shrink the font
size, the code size would have been short enough to fit
into MUCH less than 4K (5720 - 4096 = 1624, plus just the
necessary from the font, it could be less than 2K).

Now I'm not going to shrink it, since I want to reflect
exactly what was presented in the Party (except a little
bugfix).
