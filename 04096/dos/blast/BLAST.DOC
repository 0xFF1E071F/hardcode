        Hi everybody! This is Jcl of Unknown writing some words at the
  keyboard.

        I must talk about our 4Kb intro... well, here we go!!!

        This intro was presented at the Euskal 4 demoparty in 1996, in Spain,
  where it became 3rd.

        Well, first of all, the legal stuff...

        This program is freeware. This allow you to use it and spread it
  as long as nothing is changed and no money is charged for it.
  Not me nor Unknown assume any responsibilities for any damage this software
  can make to you or your computer.
        All this, in other words mean that don't sell this program to anyone,
  but spread it free. Also, if it crush your mind or your computer, do not
  blame us for that (it shouldn't do any damage, but these things must be
  put).
        The software is 100% virus-free. If the size of the BLAST.EXE file
  included in BLAST4K.ZIP is different than 4096 bytes, then, probably a virus
  has been attached to it by someone (but not by us!).

        The intro needs a 286 or better computer with a register-compatible
  VGA adapter. We haven't tested it in slower computers, but it was coded
  to show 1 frame per screen blanking in a 486-33Mhz with a (fuckin') Trident.
  I think that a 386SX-25 or a 386SX-33 will be enough (but I'm not sure).

        Now, I must talk about the intro... Well, although most of my code
  was in assembler, I only compiled a few programs in 100% ASM, instead, I
  used Asm into C or Pascal code... The result was quite big executable sizes
  and quite slow also... I never though I could made a 4Kb intro, because I
  didn't know how to code 100% ASM well...
        I put my hands on some 100% ASM demos, and I really liked one called
  FAKE (I don't know who made it now)... I had the source code from it, but
  all the parts were too big to fit in a 4Kb intro... So, after a lot of
  optimization, and rewroting almost entirely the fire and first sinus plasma
  routines, it fit in 4Kb, I did a writer for scaled bios-fonts, and here is
  the result... BLAST!

        Well, you can say I am a ripper, but notice that I changed a lot of
  things from the original effects. Think that only the fire was 20kb (com-
  pressed) in that demo... The landscape was 8kb, and the plasmas were 22Kb.
        So, I reduced the code sizes to less than 4Kb (compressed with
  PKLITE). I had to rewrite most routines, and optimize the others; some
  precalculated data had to be calculated at run-time, and all that stuff...
  (hey! a lot of code is mine too!) and don't think it is an easy work...
  I've seen many 4Kb intros that just didn't change anything in the code from
  other sources... I've also seen some 4Kb intros that only change strings
  from others 4Kb intros (like the credits, title...), and that's quite an
  easy and lame job... try compiling 80Kb (well, 80Kb compressed... 113K
  without any compression) into 4Kb... do you think it's easy? well, try it!
        And, at least I admit I ripped some code! Some people rip it and
  don't tell about that... those people are real lamers!

        I hope with this explanation you won't consider me a ripper nor a
  lamer... If you still do... well, not my problem!

        And now, with some technical aspects... I don't know exactly the
  size of the parts individually, but that's not quite important.
        The object files (.OBJ) sizes created with TASM 3.1 are:

 -> For the landscape, miscellaneous routines and main function calls
                                                                 2.265 bytes
 -> For the fire effect                                         +
                                                                   631 bytes
 -> For the miscellaneous plasma routines                       +
                                                                   648 bytes
 -> for the plasma caller routines                              +
                                                                   198 bytes
 -> for the wave plasma                                         +
                                                                  1191 bytes
 -> for the color fractal plasma                                +
                                                                   577 bytes
 -> for the scaled text and fades routines                      +
                                                                  1205 bytes
                                                                  ÄÄÄÄ
                                            That make a total of  6715 bytes

        This compiles to a 27Kb long EXE. After 'PkLiting' it, you have
  a nice 4.084 bytes EXE file (Ratio 85.2%). I've tried compressing it with
  other compressors, and I had 5100, 6700 bytes and all this kind of sizes...
  only PkLite made it less then 4Kb. Such a good compression is aquired
  making 'zero-data', that is, allocating space for (for example) palettes,
  but not initializing them, but fill them at run-time. This makes the EXE
  having (in the case of the palette) 768 zeroed bytes, that may compress
  to just 6 or 7 bytes... I mean, using DB 768 DUP(?); that doesn't
  initialize that data. With TASM 4, this data isn't even included in the
  EXE file, so you don't have to compress it.
        The size of the source codes is about 75 kilobytes long (only
  counting .ASM files, Include files (.INC,.DB) and the Makefile... comments
  also included, but there are not too much 7;ªD).
        Every part is a stand-alone program, however I made some changes so
  it won't waste code size repeating unnecessary things... anyway, I assure
  you I've left a lot of superfuous things (like generating palettes twice,
  allocating and deallocating memory instead of using the same block, etc...)
  so a lot of space is taken by this code.
 
        The fire was made in tweaked mode 80x200x256. The first plasma was
  made with the sinus map overlapping technique with 4 hotspots, in
  tweaked mode 320x400x256. The rest of the intro is made in chained 320x200
  mode (mode 13h).
        The map for the first landscape is created by the same routine as the
  final color fractal plasma, but with different parameters.
        All the palettes in the demo are generated inside the code, just
  because I had no space to save them!
        The only precalculated thing is a Sine and Cosine table that is
  320 bytes long (both sine and cosine). I tried to use the Stone/Dust
  40 bytes sinus generator, but it just was too long! That's because I had
  to call it a lot of times, and it didn't compress anything... The sine table
  compresses a lot, as it has lots of repetitions with a low scaler. The
  fact that the sinus generator don't compress is due to the way I use sinus
  and cosinus; with a different technique, this could be greatly smaller!
        I only had to insert 12 bytes to the EXE file to make it 4096 bytes
  (so the intro is really 4084 bytes long). Do you think of any effect I
  can put in 12 bytes?

        Well, as you have read, this intro is very size-optimized, but I
  think I could have done it at least 1Kb less... but, who cares?

        Included with this intro is IMPSRC.ZIP, that contains some source
  codes to make a 56 bytes long EXE (not COM!) that puts in the screen the
  words "ImphobiaCoderCompo". I wanted to present it at the Imphobia's
  Code Gems 5 Coding Compo, but, at the Euskal Party, I met Darkness/Imphobia,
  and he told me that Imphobia #12 was already out, so the compo time is out.
        I would be about the 10th or so, bcoz the minimum was 40 bytes, and
  the maximum was 67 or so... (however, most of them, including the 40 bytes
  one, that came with Imphobia #12, didn't work in my computer neither in
  Darkness' one, so I have serious doubts about'em, as they didn't include
  the source codes ;-P )

        I don't mind it. I didn't expect to win, but a 56 bytes long .EXE
  is the smallest EXE I've seen that works! (I've seen COMs in 30 bytes or
  less, but never an EXE!).

        Well, if you wanna remake it, see the instructions in IMP.ASM and
  CRACK.C... they're not very well explained, but there it is everything you
  need to know on how I did it... how you understand it is your problem (you
  will need to know about EXE headers and some other things).

        If a lot of people is interested, I will release the source codes
  of this intro, so, if you are interested, ask for them! (The most requests
  I have, the sooner they will be out)
        About the source codes, I must tell you that you will have to
  register your version of PKLITE, because without the -e option (only
  available when registering), it gets a bit more than 4Kb. For the rest
  you will only need TASM 3.1 and TLINK 3.11, (Maybe MAKE 3.6?)... and, ofcoz,
  the source codes! (TASM 4 will not work, as TASM 4 uses a different
  compiling method than 3.1)

  copper bars... how can I wait for the horizontal retrace?" or so... I
  mean, go directly to the point! If you ask me general questions, I won't
  give you any source codes, instead, I will explain you the effect (ofcoz,
  if I know how to do it!!!), but you can ask specifical things and get a
  surprise with full source codes to an effect... PLEASE, don't ask me 
  about maths for last-generation thinggies, as I'm only 16 and my math
  level is really weird.
