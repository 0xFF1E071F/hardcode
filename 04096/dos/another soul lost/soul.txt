Another soul lost by Preacher of Traction
-----------------------------------------

The story:

I had this intro already at Asm'02 but due to my coding
abilities (or lack of them) it suffered from a horrible
bug which prevented it from working under any decent
Windows. Two hours before the deadline I gave up and decided
to go to sleep instead (good call, otherwise the bar tour we
took would've been too much for me :)) 

A couple of weeks before asm'03 I fixed the bug but didn't have
the time or the motivation to do any further work on it. After
all, it's been laying on my HD for a year or so and some of the
code is even older (2-3 years even). The design is just as
unfinished as it was back then but I just want to get this
off my hands.
I did have ambitious ideas about making anything from an
anti-war intro to a complete raytracer, but my laziness and
the summer heat took the better of me. 
        
I'm going to release the source code after I've cleaned it
up a bit (and maybe even written some comments). Just ask me
for it if you want it and I'm too lazy (which is all too
likely) to do it soon.

I used APACK to pack this, it seems to be quite good at doing
what it does. It should run on just about anything, but if it doesn't,
it's not my fault ;) 

Some greetings: My former NoID group mates (how's it going?),
Aldaron (been quiet?), Se7en (I had the bloody A20 line stuff commented
out! :X), ahnion, the old #phyrexia posse + other IRC friends.. 

Extra special greetings to Tiks, it just doesn't feel the same without
you here :(

That's it I guess. Goodbye real mode, I won't miss you.
