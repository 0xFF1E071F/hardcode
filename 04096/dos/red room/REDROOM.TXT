 Notice that this 4k is unbelievable crap, if it ever gets to the
 bigscreen I'll be dead happy. Or so.

 Also special greetings to Assembly Org. Inc. You guys are so cool. Big
 thanks for the money you haven't yet send me. I know you will, eventually.
 (yeah, and pink cows walk on top of my head)
