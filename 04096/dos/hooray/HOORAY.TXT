                       - a 4k intro from Bush Party 4 -

This intro does only contain one effect, a recursive raytracing routine.
The routine is very slow, and that makes the intro boring :)

Requirements
------------
	- A 386 with a 387 FPU or better (but I've only tested the intro
	  on Pentiums :)
	- 2.5 MB free XMS memory
	- VESA 1.2 with 640x480x16 bit to run HOORAY.EXE
	- VESA 2.0 with 320x240x16 bit to run COMPO.EXE

Files
-----
	COMPO.EXE
	This is the exe-file from the compo. COMPO.EXE requires
	VESA 2.0 with 320x240 16 bit support, and bytes per scanline
	has to be 640 bytes. It was very hard to to get the
	size below 4k, and COMPO.EXE is exactly 4096 bytes. :)

	HOORAY.EXE
	This is a nicer version of the 4k intro. This file does only require
	VESA 1.2 with 640x480 16 bit support. This version does also
	got error messages. The size is therefore over 4k.
