  Fractal Life competed at the Wired'98 4K-compo. It placed 3rd out of 6.
  It requires about 350 K free memory to run. There is no error-handling, so
  if you have not enough memory free, it will probably just hang, or overwrite
  some TSR. There should be no problems running it from Win 95, though.

  Fractal Life contains:
  - Some bezier curves on a background of cellular automates.
  - 3 IFS-fractals and a nice title.
  - a whirling fractal, with some kind of motion blur.
  - a Hilbert line as a background for the crossword-greetings.
  - Conways game of Life on a infinite tiled floor.

  If you are wondering why it's only 3946 bytes, there was supposed to be an
  "THE END" - screen after the last part, but due to some strange bugs, a lack
  of sleep and the deadline, I had to remove it.

  Fractal Life was made on a 486 DX2/66, but since the competition machine was
  a P200 MMX, I had to change the timing of certain parts. As a result, you
  need at least a pentium, otherwise some parts run too long.

  Thanks to Green for the transport to Wired, and to the Wired organizing staff
  for the great party.
