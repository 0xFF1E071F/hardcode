	Intro features

	  - lots of bugs

          - freedirection planes, tunnels and spheres
          - antialiased linevectors
          - zbuffered lenses
          
	256 colormode is unfinished, And looks like hell, because
        there is no pageflipping of any kind (not enough time to code it)
	And whatta hell this intro was made for 320x200 truecolor.

	This intro was compiled hurry at partyplace, and is
