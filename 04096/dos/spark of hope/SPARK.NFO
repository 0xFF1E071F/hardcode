         tragic 4kb piece of code. maze again. maze once more.
     but please be lenient. it was written in 4days. days spent
      rather on drinking and fun than writing. just to show i still exist.
	       there is nothing new. nothing amazing. just maze.
                              i hope it will pass the selection.
                         if yes that is enough.

	cpu instructions only to 386 but no fwait is used so it should
    be run on pentium. in fact it really shouldn't be run on anything
          under p120. on my 120 (L1:8:8) goes on average 25 fps.
         vesa 2.0 is used (320x200x15bpp LFB) so use univesa if any
        problems. if doesn't help then try fakemode version.
		but better do not do that.
                     no sound no 3dfx so no problem.
                  xms memory is used so install himem.sys.
	flat mode so no windoze and emm386.
         about 2MB of hi memory.

                       i heard somewhere that people think i am ripper.
            thay say maze was fully ripped. that's fuckin shit.
         no byte was ripped from anywhere. all code (except com compressor)
      was written by me. only me. tihocan helped me with design and that
    is all. i know that some parts are similar to other productions.
                  especially those two torus tunels. but the hell
                it's 4kb intro. not demo. first try to do something like
	   that and then you can criticize my child.
   would you send fucks to someone who fits second reality in 4kb ?
     i would not. i admire good hard code.
        and all effects were done many times before so i haven't taken 
                             somebody's new idea.
				i know that some parts of spark look
					known. but again i say :
		   it's 4kb. and show me anybody who does only new effects
	                        based only on own ideas.
