        Requirements:
          - Fast Pentium
          - VGA
          - About 200kb of base mem

        Note:

          This little intro has been testd on a Penitum 133 and 
          it ran fine. I suggest you don't try to run it on a 486
          because it has a much slower FPU. The balls don't have 
          any reflections nor specular highlights. The thing was 
          slow enough without them. The final release might be out 
          later. Oh, if you are wondering why the intro is so slow,
          it's because of the realtime raytracing. Wow ;)
