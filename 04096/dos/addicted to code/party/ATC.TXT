	Yeah, i know it looks exactly the same as my previos 4kb,
	but just take it as my style, get used or get the f... out :)
	And believe me, its far far more advanced then former ones.
	It took me nearly two weeks to code (am i getting to old for
	that ? ;), so maybe ones with some 4kb coding experience
	will see the difference.
	  It's 100% my work. My flat-mode extender, my xms routines,
	my timer, my textures, my fonts and my compressor.
	  Pharhaps its the last time i code anything in real-flat-mode,
	whether we like it or not its protected(?) windoze time :-(((
	So the intro is just for fun and to say goodbye to good old
	times.

	-himem.sys required.	
	-intro uses real flat mode, so turn of windoze, emm386, etc.
	-runs in 320x200x15bpp video mode, try univbe if doesnt work
	 or (when desperate ;) try fake mode version (atc_fk.com).
	 i have heard that on some gfx cards (i.e. riva tnt II) there
	 are no 15bpp modes at all, so i made 16bpp version, just
	 try (atc_16b.com).
	-i am not sure, but probably about 3 megs of xms memory needed.
