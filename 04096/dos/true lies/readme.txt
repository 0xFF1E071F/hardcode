this is oldschool ms-dos ascii executable made with bat2exe
it displays ascii then pause>nul and waits. if you don't use
real computer please don't use these modern pc's because it
has characters that displays wrong becuase microsoft changed
the character set unless you don't load the correct codepage
etc. so png is best way unless you don't use the old pc's
kthnx bai
