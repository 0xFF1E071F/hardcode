General
-------

   Little Big Demo II was done by Pinker of SANCTION for the Wired '96.
   It place first out of 12.
   
   Special thanks in alphabetical order :

       Andreas Mautsch     (beta testing)
       Christian Cohnen    (blob algorithm, additional coding)                      
       Christian Rattat    (LZSS77 packing algorithm)      
       Christoph Brandtner (source support)                  
       Stephanie Schepers  (moral and food support ;-)  )     
                                               
       and all other SANCTION dudes for supporting this product !                               


Demo controls
-------------

   <Esc> stops the intro.
   <Tab> jumps to the next part :-)


Specials
--------

   - Every part fades in and out.
   - No pure red, green or blue color palettes are used.
   - Most of the parts are interrupt timed.
   - The unpacked size of the intro is only 4636, because the source is
     highly optimized for size (and unfortunately not for speed ;-)). 
   - The unpack header is 250 bytes. We use a dynamic LZSS77_ari packing 
     algorithm using 8 bit fixed pointers.
   

System requirements
-------------------

   WARNING ! LBD2 uses an extremly aggressive memory management, so give
   approx. 400 Kb of free and fresh conventional memory to it !
   There should be no probs running it with Win95, though :-)
   Your computer needs at least 100Mhz pentium horse power. 
   You can use it with any soundcard but You wouldn't hear any
   kind of music :-(


Technical stuff
---------------
   
Part 1
   Simple zoomer & smoother, random placed dots and a system-font logo on
   a sine-curve.

Part 2
   REAL phongshading with one moving lightsource and an illuminated
   bumped background.
   The logo consists of 1920 triangular faces and is calculated with a
   3D-Blob-Mesh algorithm. The systemfont was not used to avoid distorted
   characters on alien fonts.

Part 3
   Another 3D-Blob-Mesh logo.
   The logo is smoothed.
   LBD2 means Little Big Demo 2.

Part 4
   2D-Blob routine with 8 negative and 8 positive moving blobs.

Part 5
   Well :-)
   Guess, how it is done.
   Hint: it is a highly mathematical thing called 'texture fractal'.

Part 6
   Simple tunnel with colors instead of a texture.

Part 7
   Environment shading with a great particle fire,
   first coded by flap of capacala.
